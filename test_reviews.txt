I purchased a cake today from a store in Peoria AZ and I made a mistake! I ordered a chocolate 1/4 sheet whipped frosting cake. I got it home and right away I decided to try it. It was NASTY! I had never purchased a cake from you guys, but decided to give it a try, and I should have never done it... I would rather eat a boxed cake mix from the store, then another one from your bakery... I will never make that same mistake!
Wish I could give more stars. However I just met some woman tonight at a fashion event... I am assuming that she works for this shop. When I asked "did you make the cupcakes! They were amazing ", she gave me a nasty reply with "the desserts?" Ummm! she could've simply said "yes" I made all of the desserts. This lady was a total complete bitch!  Not too sure who pissed in her cornflakes this afternoon. But I was just asking a question. I was actually very excited to meet the person who made these yummy cupcakes! So here's a thought to the woman with the nasty attitude.....Maybe that's the only dessert I was able to eat at the time! I'm sure the other desserts were good, BUT! Her attitude was absolutely disgusting! Everyone else saw her and started talking about her..... Very Unprofessional! I quickly dismissed her with a "NEVERMIND" after she snapped at me. Needless to say I will not ever come to this shop, and I will be sure to spread the word to everyone else.
This is a McDonald's.  The food tastes the same no matter which one you go to, and it's perfectly fine for a late-night fast food fix.  However, this one will never give you the correct food.  Even if employees outnumber patrons three to one, you had better open up every box to make sure you get what you ordered.  Not just look in the bag.  Look in the boxes.  The employees are friendly enough when you point out their mistakes.  It's not like they're maliciously screwing up your order.  But an order consisting of a Double Quarter-pounder with cheese (yes, that's TWO WHOLE PATTIES, WITH CHEESE), two apple pies and an order of fries should not be difficult to assemble.  You want an Angus burger?  It's a toss-up whether what comes on the burger is even close to what you ordered.    I don't want to think about what this place turns into during the lunch rush.
Waited 10 minutes in DT for 3 sandwiches that were cold when I got them, the Mexican in the window only told me to have a good day when I asked what took 10 minutes for me to get my food... 3 other cars that ordered all drove off before I got my food! Horrible service and long wait times, cold food
This Mc Donald's is always a long wait, the staff on 2nd shift into 3rd will make you wait for any food item without informing you of a wait, I waited on average 12 minutes in drive thru for 2 Mc Doubles and a small Coke, and the sandwiches were both cold so I brought them in and complained why I had cold food on a 14 minute DT wait when I was the first customer in the DT and 3 cars that ordered behind me left without their food. I asked the staff why it took so long and never got an answer or apology. The staff here also do not wear name tags to use to complain. The picture I will post here is the woman who is very rude always on 2nd shift into 3rd. The asks "May I help you?" As though you are worthless to her and not a customer. I will no longer come here or to any Mc Donald's in the area for fear of crappy service!
Horrible!!!... many people's working,but not one of them try to serve us,waiting forever. ...
I waited for months for this. A promise of a sweet treat from back east like an ice I would get in a pizza shop in the Bronx 20 years ago. Marionos I believe they were called. This was worse then a snow cone from the purple penguins place. At least the shaved ice had a flavor to it and much better smoothness going down. Heres the deal I heard a customer ask what's the difference between ice cream and custard. The kid behind the counter responded the texture that's the only diff. LoL I'm flabber gasted. As I watched another child prying threw the orange flavored water with what looked to be a crowbar for idiots. (please see comment on custard) it looked like the bottom of a slurpee cup after all liquid was sucked out. In closing I felt it this serious to make my profile pic one of which I thought could express how I felt about Rita's maybe on a boardwalk in a bad part of town but no respectable NYer would ever classify this as an Italian Ice. If it wasn't free I would have got a refund. Sorry I was sad too
I've been to Rita's a few times and am yet to be impressed. The ice was a lil runny and the custard tasted like old frozen cool whip. I thought maybe it was a one time thing but after several visits, I found nothing has changed. Most of the times I have been there the service was decent but the last time I was there I was less than impressed with how the staff spoke to each other and customers. I love Italian Ice but would rather drive across town than try this place again.
The custard was very tasty! HOWEVER, I will never return to eat it again because the customer service here was beyond rude! My niece was leaning on the counter deciding what she wanted but as any other 6 year old would do, she was messing with the tinsel decoration they had on the sides of the counters. She wasn't  tearing it off, she was just playing with it with her fingers. The female worker immediately snapped at her and told her to stop. She should have went about it a whole different way. She could have asked me, THE GUARDIAN of my niece, to tell her to stop. But instead, she snapped at my niece and by the time we got into the car my niece didn't even want to eat the ice cream because she felt like she didn't deserve it because the lady was angry with her. Worst experience I have ever had with my niece all because of an over the top rude employee!
Worst customer service ever! Walked in and there was 1 customer with 2 kids and 2 employees working! Instead of helping us both employees continued to assist the one customer!! We finally walked out and will not be returning to this location as we love Rita's but customer service is everything!!!!
There wear a ton of flavors to choose from , but I was not that impressed with my indecision.  It may have something to do with the employees. They did not know their products or what was on the menu. Not only did they not know their menu they were extremely rude. Overall horrible experience I will Not be going back to this location.
Can't speak for the ice cream itself due to the fact I was never served. Being pregnant and craving something sweet, I stopped in here to get some Italian ice. I've never been in Rita's before so I asked the guy behind the counter about flavors. All he said was they're up there (pointing to the board) and said we're out of some flavors. He then said I'm going to the back. I made my decision and looked in the doorway only to find him stirring something in a bucket. So I left with nothing. Is that good customer service? How do you just leave a customer standing there? I won't say I won't ever go into a Rita's establishment but, I won't be going to this particular location again.
Never have I ever been so disappointed. I called Erik in hopes of a balayage hair style. He said he could do it, awesome! After we  talk about what to do, he charged me $145 for cut and color. After being rushed out for a walk in, I went back the next day to finish, BAD IDEA. He ended up adding more high lights, making my hair bright and brassy, then puts a toner over it, and ruins my hair. I cried for a day trying to figure out what to do. I call him and ask for at least half of my refund because I had to go to another salon (where they actually knew what balayage was) and he tells me he won't do that, but he will try to bleach my hair AGAIN!( I have natural curly mixed hair) he didn't know how to straighten it, literally steam was coming up because it wasn't dry all the way, and everyone knows you can only bleach it so many times before it breaks off. I ended up having to spend another $50 to fix my roots and try to start the actual balayage style. He owns the shop, and as a manager and owner, he should know the right thing to do to make a customer happy. He high balled me at the price in the first place, all which goes into his pocket. A fancier Great Clips, at best. I do not recommend this guy to do any type of hair processing.
I took my 5yr old to get a hair cut and Erik said he could squeeze us in. He was finishing up a guy and waiting for his next appointment when he decided to bring my son in instead since the guy was late. He gave my the worst haircut ever his hair is uneven, his sides look disgusting. He literally gave my son 5-7 min haircut, like he just wanted our money really quick . I'm the the kinda to talk shit and start being rude and demanding so I just left and promise to write a review. WE WILL NEVER GO BACK TO HIM OR THE SALON. Or recommend it.
This guy gives everyone the same horrible haircut no matter what you ask for. He asks what you want and then does his own thing anyway. The only good thing about this place is that there's no wait because nobody wants to go there. All I asked for was a complete shave all around my head and I came out with a "school bully" fade. Time to hit the bball courts as I now have a reputation to withhold on the streets with this new cut.
This place is awful. Receptionist misplaced my paperwork. People that came in after me were seen before me. Not a very good experience
If you are planning to drive out to BFE to see Pulte's heavily advertised "$130K" homes, think again.  Once you make the 2 hour one-way trip, you will find that these don't really exist.  I didn't even see it listed on the price sheet and there certainly wasn't a model of said house.  I believe the bare-bones homes with no upgrades were starting in the $160s.  Is baiting and switching legal in Arizona?  I want my gas money and 4 hours of my life back.  :-\
I will NOT recommend to buy a home in Parkside Anthem at Merrill Ranch...HOA fee is very high from $150 and up per month.  PLEASE, think twice before you make the final decision... I moved in 2015. Only one big pool , no hot tubs, the kids park is open  2-3 month a year, cold water , open just few hours only on Monday, Wednesday , Friday, Saturday n Sunday afternoon... they closed the diving boards, no free basic cable... waist of money... If you have relative, friends visiting you, they have to pay extra, ONLY who is on the deed used all for free, if you stay at the pool or gym  with your friends / relatives they will pay only $3 per day per person, but if you do not stay, they will pay $5 per day and because my son and my brother visit me on the same time, my son had a pass $60 for 10 days n my brother was going with my son and my brother paid $3 per day... the pool is closed December to March ( does not heat the pool ) need a inside pool , hot tub , or Jacuzzi .... There are few sports field ,huge playground, huge gym,  2-3 people play/use it ... HUGE waist of money ... The Anthem Parkside is located between animals farms , you can not believe the BAD SMELL from the animals dung, muck, excrement, droppings, cow pats, cow chips, every morning and night.... and every other day will smell fertilizer, chemicals or asbestos very strong asbestos smell, they are intoxicating our longs... I recommend you at least check before, I didn't,  I just trust my Realtor...  :(*
I purchased a home in this community and costumer service went from sweet to sour. People don't take the time to listen and they make sarcastic comments like if I don't know a thing about a new home. This is my 4th house and my worst experience. I don't want to deal with Alex our construction sup so I will be doing some of the work myself. Good luck guys.
Staff friendly but I am not happy at all with my dog's haircut. Her face was trimmed poorly and was nothing like her breed should be. I won't be going back.
This place was supposed to be the new best sushi place in the area. Lets just say I have no idea why so many great reviews have been written. I got out of the car and the smell of rotten fish overwhelmed the parking lot. We got inside and at first it looked great but when we sat down to get our drinks the waitress was super short and snappy. They don't have any liquor, only beer, short wine list, and hot saki (not even cold.) Their buffet food was not worth 21.50 either. I am a sushi fanatic, not to be confused with a sushi snob tho - I have had grocery store sushi better than what they offer here. The avocado was not ripe at all and the rice wasn't cooked right. Needless to say it was quite the chew. They did have a wide variety of other things on the buffet but none of which were very good. The lo mien was GROSS, the broccoli was completely overcooked, and the egg roll tasted like strawberry yogurt. The only decent thing I got was the sesame chicken. My guest felt the same way, and at the end of the meal decided he would try the banana pudding, thinking how on earth could anyone mess up banana pudding - well Fuse can. So anyway, we ended up with a fifty six dollar tab (before tip) for two buffet plates and one bottle of terrible saki. I have eaten at Enzo (downtown, top notch, best sushi in Charlotte) and paid about 72 for the same thing. Needless to say, don't waste your time here. It may have a great location, but I promise the drive elsewhere is worth the quality of the food your good eat. Sorry Fuse! Figure it out.
My boyfriend and I wanted to go out for a nice dinner and decided to try Fuse since neither of us had ever been there. We checked out the website and although the price was a bit steep for a buffet, at $19.95, the pictures looked delicious and we figured it was worth a shot.   Upon walking in, we had a bit stand-offish customer service but we were seated right away in a nice clean and quiet booth in a lovely restaurant. My first stop after ordering our drinks was the restroom. I wish the offensive lingering smell would have warned me of things to come. My first red-flag was the obvious cigarette burns on the toilet paper holder but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and  headed back out.  We then had a look around at the buffet and things seemed okay, so we decided to try it, despite our hesitation over the 91.5 food score rating. First stop was the noodle bar, which served a soupy noodle dish that was bland at best. Our second trip to the buffet included a plate of sushi, most of which was EXTREMELY over-stuffed with cream cheese. The sashimi was very dried out and chewy.   Round three we moved onto the hot food. The duck, which had been the reason we were most excited to try the hot food, was all fat and bones. The sesame chicken was gristle and breading. I was especially excited to try the baked scallops and cheese, but once again, the ENTIRE scallop shell was FILLED with cream cheese to a nauseating level.   At this point we had had enough, so we called the owner to explain our disappointment. He actually agreed that the food was not good saying "yes we have to Americanize it"  and expressed that my British boyfriend wasn't used to the Americanized food and that  "Americans like cream cheese" The owner then stated " I tell the chef to buy better duck, but he won't"   One would think that as the owner, who is listening to customer complaints, would be able to make those kinds of decisions!  He offered to cook us more bad food, which we refused, obviously, and we requested he discount the meal, which he completely refused saying things like, "it's a buffet, you understand."  I recommend you do not go anywhere NEAR this restaurant. They will take your money off you without any sympathy and leave you with at best a bad memory and a seriously upset stomach.
Frozen fish.  They ran out of salmon and tuna very quickly so I asked for more.  They brought out fish still crunchy with ice in the center of it.  I could write more about how the lobster concoction reeks of trimethylamine (window cleaner) and cheap/old fish.  I won't say more because frozen sushi is not acceptable and if you go here i hope you like crab because you will be overpaying for a buffet with a very poor showing when it comes to non-crab seafood.
One of my worst experiences ever.  Food was OK.  Not great, not bad.  Very stereotypical of the type of restaurant.  My problem lies with the staff.  No one we tried to speak to spoke English.  We just got a lot of head nodding no matter what we asked.  There was a table of loud twenty-somethings.  They were so loud people on the other side of the restaurant could hear them, kept looking their way and shaking their heads.  This is a large establishment.  No one came over and asked them to quiet down.  They were so loud (I was about 3 tables away) I could not hear what my dinner partner was saying.  I got up, went to the hostess (whose English was better than anyone else's) and asked to see the manager.  All I received was a blank stare.  I asked three times.  Nothing.  I sat back down, and the rude table only got louder.  I finally got up and went over to the table myself.  This only made them even more rude.  I went back up to the buffet to get some food, turned around and the leader of the bunch was literally in my face telling me I'm a bitch and if I touch him he will call the police.  I backed up, (remember, he invaded my space) and started yelling, hoping management would now come out.  STILL NOTHING!  I won't eat where management does not have a backbone if a customer is being threatened.  I'm a very small woman.  I'm the only one who stood up against these people.  There were large men in the restaurant.  No one.  People thanked me.  No one helped.  Where was management?
all they got going for them is crab legs the soda is watered down and there food is bland take it from a buffet lover i finally found a buffet to hate..
If you want to be ignored, service with a frown, dirty tables, and  and overall filthy restaurant, eat here!!  OMG!!  They replenish the sushi bar with fresh sushi on dirty plates.  I really wish I was exaggerating. This place is a total disaster. I don't how it's gotten okay reviews.  Don't eat here.
As far as Chinese Buffets go, I was honestly surprised with how bad every single item here was. There wasn't a single saving grace dish, which is basically impossible for any restaurant. Highly highly do NOT recommend. Lotus Buffet is right down the street, much better food across the board, and less expensive.
food is ok.service!!?? lets just say rude!!! our server didnt say much other than how many ppl ..no refills unless we asked..!i should have listen to my friends..this place sucks!!
Really sucked today. Also a bathroom tells me a lot about a restaurant & I literally almost threw up when I went to the bathroom. This place is disgusting. Staff is not friendly. Go somewhere else!!
I do not normally take the time out of my busy day to write reviews; however, because of the exceptionally HORRIBLE service and treatment this company provided me, I really believe everyone needs to know. They arrived 4 HOURS LATE with only 2 guys when they promised 3. They did not bring the supplies they promised, such as packing material or wardrobe boxes. They were horrible about organizing my belongings in the truck and if my brother-in-law had not been there to assist, they would have had to take another trip! They broke my coffee table and washer! They took 9 hours when they should have taken less than 6 hours and did not even set up anything where it belonged as they promised. The owner had to come help them and send another guy at 9 pm!! To top it off the new guy they brought at 9 pm STOLE my iPhone and then they took my entertainment shelves with them since they left in such a hurry. The owner has promised to pay me for the phone, return my shelves and fix my washer--all of which he has not done and it has been a MONTH!! PLEASE PLEASE spread the word--DO NOT USE THEM!! They are thieves and are cheap for a reason!! YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR--JUST PAY A LITTLE EXTRA FOR BETTER SERVICE! I promise you will regret using them.
AWFUL - DO NOT USE.   I used this company for the move of my home - of which, I had already moved everything that I could on my own with few remaining objects in the (the large things that I had no means to transport--couch, bed, dining table, etc).  I scheduled the move to begin from 8-9, and the owner assured me the drivers would arrive close to 8:00 am.   By nearly 10:00 am, I was fed up with waiting because I had taken time off from work as well as requested a family member to take time off from work to help with the move and my time was being wasted.  I called the owner around 9:45 am to notify him that if the movers were not in my driveway by 10:00 am to call them and cancel because I didn't have time to waste.  At which point I was SCREAMED at, BERATED, INSULTED, and DAMNED as another "awful customer" that he's "sick of".  At which point he screamed at he is "in his car and 'bout to come tell me his opinion".  - I feared for my safety that I may be physically harmed and almost called the police.  At 10:00 (almost on the dot) the movers arrived - two tattoo'd kids in an un-labeled moving truck.  Still out of fear for my safety now that 3 (including the owner that was "on his way") angry, unprofessional, and creepy men were arriving at my home, I continued with the move -- I texted all of my neighbors to please be on guard and listen carefully for my voice if I needed their help.   1.5 hours later, damaged walls, their bathroom breaks in my house, sitting in the car with their boss and not working for a 15-20 minute period, the move was done and ready to be taken to the new house. The owner did, by the way, come to my house in his PAJAMAS to fix two damaged spots on the wall (there were actually more), which took him about 45 minutes because he didn't have any supplies and had to go to Walmart to get them. He also took the opportunity to complain about having to clean up the damage of the employees to talk about all the others things he felt were structurally wrong with my house which was built only 1 yr ago and we were the first owners.  The drivers did not have GPS or any form to be contacted (no working phones) and I had to trust that they would closely follow behind me.  Which they did - they turned corners like mad men and I feared for my belongings.  At the new house,  I was informed that my belongings would not be unloaded until I paid - which is fine.  However, the owner took about 30 minutes to send the pay pal email which again was a lot of arguing, screaming at me, and berating me - which I had on speaker phone for my family member and his employees to hear.  All of which were shaking their heads and apologizing saying that I did not deserve such treatment. He also tacked on a $40 charge for "shrink wrap" because he told him employees, without my knowledge, to wrap a cupboard of mine (which I had the supplies to do myself, and it was already taped shut)--having that removed was another argument, which the employees ended up taking over on my behalf.  Additionally, he asked how I would be paying and I told him via debit card, and he screamed at me for probably two minutes about how he doesn't accept e-checks, each time I replied, "As previously stated, that shouldn't be an issue since I'm paying with a debit card."  Throughout the move, the employees were talking about drugs, dealing shrooms, etc.  Because they had no phones, their boss kept calling MY phone and asking to speak to them about non-work related crap on MY time, MY dime, MY phone.    After the movers left, the owner called to apologize for his behavior.  Well, my leather couch is completely ruined, and many other things are damaged.  Not only that, I have never been so disrespected by a disgusting, nasty, man in my entire life - so take your apology and SHOVE IT!   Do not use this company if you value your safety, dignity, and belongings.  I cannot tell you how many times I felt I almost had to call the police to supervise the activity, and foolishly out of fear for my safety and belongings did not.
DO NOT USE GIT R DONE!!!! I used them several years ago and it was a total disaster. They were unprofessional, unethical, tardy, and they broke and damaged thousands and thousands of dollars' worth of my furniture and other goods. They were 3 hours late. They showed up with a small box truck, so it took two trips. The quote they gave me was for enough time for 1 trip. Then at the end of the day, they tried to charge me for time for both trips, which was over double the original quote.   They forgot to bring a dolly, so they used mine. Then they broke it and left it outside after the move next to some beer bottles that I assume were there's, since it was not ours. They stacked boxes on the dolly four boxes high, then dropped the top box, which happened to be our dishes and were clearly marked "Fragile". Then they blamed us for the dishes breaking saying that they were wrapped in bubble wrap and should have been wrapped in plain paper.  They scratched our hardwood floors. They scratched and put holes in our huge leather sectional. They put our Sony 5 disc DVD Surround Sound system on the floor of the truck and put boxes on top of it. The CD player could not hold the weight of the boxes (DUH) and was shattered on the front... ruined.  My husband walked outside to find one guy on the truck tossing our CD/DVD wooden 6 foot tall DVD stand to a guy on the ground. The guy missed it, so it fell to the ground and shattered. Due to all these problems, the "manager" of the move went outside and began cursing the other guys out up onside and down the other. (Welcome to the neighborhood?) It was a total embarrassment to us, as we were just moving in and this was the first interaction my new neighbors saw.  So many items were broken in the move... they clearly had NO idea what they were doing.  The owner of the business came to our home and took pictures of all the damage - the floor, the sectional, broken dishes, surround sound, other misc items. He promised to make good on it.  He never paid a penny toward the damages. He is a liar, as he told us straight to our faces he would "make it right".  Years later... not a penny.     I have moved 15 times in my life, many times cross country. I have never had this kind of problem. WORST MOVE EVER!  Thanks to Git R Done!  I filed a complaint with the BBB. Another complaint had just been posted a few days prior to mine. The score of Git R Done plummeted to an "F". Then Git R Done submitted a letter to BBB stating that the problems had all been resolved, yet was discussing a move that wasn't ours. Talking about pictures that we didn't have on a date that wasn't our move!  I submitted a rebuttal letter telling them that the problems have NOT been fixed. I guess that Git R Done had paid their dues or something because mysteriously my complaint and the other complaint disappeared off the BBB site, causing Git R Done's grade to go up to an "A". I have no faith whatsoever in the BBB due to this incident.  If I could grade Git R Done as a 0 or a negative number, I would. It was by far, the worst "service" I have ever received. I had to go out and buy new dishes, new surround sound system, new DVD stand, and other miscellaneous items. I had to pay someone to come in and repair my floor. My couch could not be repaired, so I had to just live with the scratches and holes, and every time I see them, it's a reminder of the move from hell.    DO NOT USE GIT R DONE!  They suck
What a joke this guy and his employees should be thrown in jail....Words can not  explain how disgusted I am with Git R Done and the crew! Dropping F bombs in front of our kid and my wife...not cool! foreman threaten me till I told him to go ahead as I would then own the company and fire his A$$! after sueing him...plus being a former police officer I am pretty sure I could have taken him! USELESS! CRAPPY SERVICE and just plain DUMB!  Do Not Use GIT R DONE!!!
I tried to give this moving company a try even though they had bad reviews. I am not from Phoenix and I am prior military so this would have been my first move on my own. I spoken to Abdual personally and told him everything in my house and all details. I was quoted a varily fair price and was happy at the moment.....  MOVING DAY: First off they were supposed to arrive between 9-10am which they did not show up until 1245pm. First mistake. The two young men that did show up were very rude and very unprofessional. They looked around my house and and seemed to have attitudes bc of the amount of items in my home OH DID I MENTION THEY SHOWED UP WITH A SMALL BUDGET TRUCK? SERIOUSLY! and to top it off had the adacity to say it was going to cost more! SERIOSLY! HOW CAN YOU SET YOUR OWN PRICES WHEN I SPOKEN TO THE MANAGER, BUT THATS HOW THEY GET YOU I'VE BEEN INFORMED AFTER THE FACT! Honestly I believe they didn't want to earn they paycheck. I tried calling Abdual regarding his employees in front of them but he wouldn't answer the phone for me, but would answer for his movers. BAD IDEA.....Secondly they was just so much rudeness and attitudes that I sent them on they way....I REFUSE to work with unprofessionalism. ESPECIALLY SINCE I'M PAYING YOU!!! I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone. Beside being tardy, changing prices, rudeness, unprofessionalism, attitudes, I'm good....I called another company off Craigslist that was there within 2 hours and did the job. They were professional and I would RECOMMEND them to anyone!!!   DONT USE THIS COMPANY!!! STAY AWAY!!!!
Horrible is not even the right word to describe this company.  My quote to move was $394 with 3 guys, 3 trips and almost 10 hours later they didn't even finish the job.  The three man crew smelled of marijuana, were the most unproffessional rude people I've ever met in my life.  They dropped my sons dresser, lost pieces of my furniture and let my two dogs escape.  When I asked if they knew my dogs got loose they responded with "oh yeah we were loading Shit up".  It was unreal truly one of the worst expereinces I've ever had in my life.  They were not apologetic about leaving bits and pieces of my sons beds all over the place, losing my dogs, taking my money, being the slowest people I've every encountered.  Truly a joke and scam.    NEVER EVER EVER USE THEM!
This is an awful company.  Was in a lurch to get movers when I bought oversized furniture on Craigslist.  They were TWO HOURS late....awkward to hang out at a stranger's house for that long.  Like another post, they didn't have the right equipment to move the stuff, but they got it done.  When I got home, the furniture was too big (my fault), but they said for an extra cost, they could use their carpentry skills to fix the problem.  They didn't show up the day or time we agreed on, then the same thing happened the next day.  We rearranged our plans both days so that we would be home....mistake.  When I called to ask where they were, the guy didn't even know what job I was talking about.  After a minute, he had all kinds of excuses.  This experience was a headache!!  I would never recommend this company.
Trust the reviews you see on here.  That many people can't be wrong.  They were no shows for me.  Super friendly through the sales process and then gone.
The auto glass company that is set up here is super shady. They rescheduled our appointment 4 times and still never showed up. We finally had to cancel our order. Not happy at all. Stay away!!
Worst experience ever. Not only did they do a terrible job, they made me argue with them for 30 minutes to get them to HONOR their own coupon they sent me in the mail!  Would not, and will not recommend them to anyone.
I took my car there for $149 detail! They told me it would take 2-3 hours, not a problem! I picked up the car and they did a good job! I tipped the guy $20 and drove home.  It wasn't until I drove to work Monday that I realized several of my personal belongings were missing! Still not a problem....I will stop by on the way home!  So Monday afternoon I stopped by and now there was a problem! Nothing of mine in their lost and found!  I went home and my husband called to talk with the manager, who was not there....so he requested for him to return his call the next day!  Never heard from the manager! But what really got me was Thursday when I filled up for gas I went to get some spare change for a soda that I keep in the car and it was gone! I called the car wash and spoke with the manager, Steve, about my experience!  He took down my name & phone #, told me he wanted to do some investigating and would get back to me.......haven't heard a word!  So if you want your cleaned and cleaned out, this is the place to go!
Sunglasses were stolen out of the glovebox. The onsite manager and KIDS that washed my car gave me attitude about it afterwards. Cops came. Still no sunglasses. Best part, their Corporate VP offered me free car washes as the "best they could do" even after admitting to me he'd never go back to a place that stole from him! AVOID FULL CIRCLE CAR WASH AT ALL COSTS!!!
Took the car to get washed here figuring it would save time... Not so much, since we had to clean the car when we got home. Windows were streaky and a little gross, a ton of dirt still on the car and the vacuuming was a joke. $20 plus a $2 tip completely wasted.
My husband took our vehicle in to get a car wash last week. After they (thought) were finished came in to get my husband to show that one of the windows had fallen down into the door. It is an older vehicle so this is a possibility to have happen...interesting part is that it is a new window and track...there should not have been a problem. My husband explained that this WAS a problem and the "customer service" person then said, "Well, it's not MY problem." Anyone that has any customer service skills at all knows not to say something like that. After my husband settled down from that whole episode he looked more closely at our vehicle only to find that the vacuum job was horrible. There was also still debris on the outside of the vehicle. My husband normally washes our vehicles and this is exactly why. The unfortunate part about the whole thing is that my husband was just getting it cleaned so we can turn the vehicle over to the person who is buying it from us. We will never go back to this car wash again and the experience is just a strong reminder of why we wash our own vehicles.
I went to your Southern and Power location on Friday 9/13 to have my car washed and within 5 minutes of driving up you had lost a paying customer. There were no other customers there so it leaves me to wonder how many customers are lost from LOUSEY customer service. I understand the desire in business to upsell, I get it...but not at the expense of sounding like the other services offered are horrible and not worth the money. I pulled up and asked the prices (since no one was there I was waved forward before having a chance to see them). Of course he tried selling me the $119 job to buff out a scratch and I declined. I asked the prices of normal car washes and he started telling me prices and what they entailed. I said I would take the V.I.P and your employee proceeded to tell me the interior protectant with the V.I.P would just be covering the dirt and look tacky. I said "are you telling me the interior doesn't get cleaned??" He said, not to where it wont be covering dirt and looking tacky.... Sooooo, I asked them to shut my doors so I could leave. Who in their right mind would spend $20 to have their car "cleaned" in such a manner? Not Me!
Visited 1/3/14  This is the worst car wash around!!  I have been several times. Each time I go I swear I won't go back. And then several months later convince myself to give it another chance.   On this last visit, I tried again. Convinced myself that it would be better.   After I drove away and got into the sun where I could see the interior, it was obvious they have not improved. Dash as smeared with treatment. Windows were horrible, almost like they used the same cloth as they used on the interior.  I spent an hour cleaning windows and re-doing areas after I got home.   I have also had similar experiences of pushy glass repair people as indicated in other reviews.   Unfortunately, there are very few options.  But my suggestion is to either do it yourself or drive the extra time to a better location.
Absolutely awful. Don't get your car washed here. Too much money for the result. I had to re-clean my car after they cleaned. Three different teams wiped my car down and still missed major spots. Not to mention, they were using dirty rags. They will NOT be getting my business anytime soon.
Just spent $44 for the "best" car wash and when I got back into my car the door panels were still dirty, the glass was still dirty. When I told them about it the exact words were "you have to pay extra to clean the windows" needless to say I was a bit mad. Defiantly will never return to this car was again.
Warning, Do Not Buy Groupon...Spent $25.00 for six "elite" car washes at Full Circle Car Wash.  The first one,  the car was cleaned inside and out.  But wash 2-6, was exterior water only,  no wiping.  I can go down the street and run my car through a wash and get wet and wiped down for less...A giant rip off!!!  I have gone "full circle", alright!!!  Never again will I go to that misleading, ELITE car wash or use Groupon...(Hey Groupon check the quality of what you sell...)
I've been here a few times because it's so close to my house but it's really not very good at all and has damaged my interior paint. They have several people who come up to you and try to pressure you replace your windshield if you have a chip, they guy who you purchase your wash from makes me uncomfortable and the washes aren't great. On my most recent visit, they used some type of cleaner on my interior door panel that actually took the paint off!! I didn't realize it until a few days later. Now one of my door panels is half stripped of paint and looks awful!
Went to this car wash yesterday only because it was right on my way home. I paid for their top car wash. They did not wipe down the back seat, they didn't clean the mats, they didn't wipe down the dash. While we were sitting in the waiting area, other people that were getting their cars detailed were notified by the employees when it was done. When ours  was done, the kid stood outside the window and screamed until everyone turned to see what the commotion was, then he waved to us. We just assumed that meant our car was ready. When we got into the vehicle the keys were nowhere to be found. We asked the crew where they were and one joked "I've never lost a car yet" After searching for a bit we finally noticed they were on the hood of the truck. Why they were there I have no idea. The exterior of the truck has streaks all over it because they don't even hand wash it, you have to drive it through their carwash yourself, just like as if you went through a Chevron drive-thru car wash. I paid almost $30.00 for this service and it was worth maybe $5.00. I will never go to this car wash again. Where will I go? To Cobblestone Car Wash. Even though it is a drive from Queen Creek it is so worth it.  I will only go there from now on.
First time there today. Not impressed. Just needed a simple oil change. I was told that a car wash was included in the charge and that my car would be done in about 30 minutes. An hour later i started questioning the kids outside who are washing the cars. Turns out that my car had been done for over 30 minutes, nobody had ever came inside to give me my keys. Definitely not going back. Paid nearly 50 bucks and got terrible service.
So paid for their top tier car wash and hand wax today on my F250. None of the interior was vaccumed, the dash was not wiped down, none of the interior windows were cleaned. I read the reviews and got it washed here despite my better judgement. There is still dirt on the outside. How The hell Do You Hand Wax A Truck With Dirt Still On it? I do not do reviews often. However, for the price I paid and the wash I got says I will never go back to this carwash.
I don't usually go to the car wash as hubby always washes the car. But he was out of town and car was dirty. I went and asked for exterior wash not expecting a perfect job, just wanting the car not to look dirty. I went for the plain $5 wash, long story short the exterior was okay except for the hatch. The rear of the car looked like I didn't even go through the car wash. It looked the same way I brought it in. I didn't notice until I got home and called the manager. He told me to come back and go through the car wash again. This time I emphasized to the attendant to pay special attention to the rear. It was somewhat better the second time.  The groove with the license plate still was gross and dirty...so buyer beware! Who's got time for bad service a five minute car wash turned into a 45 minute headache.
I hope that management sees this and does something about it. Your sales people are ridiculous. I understand you have to add on to the sale but lying is a whole different ball game. I asked for the VIP and when I requested they put the natural finish on the dash instead of the glossy, which I have done 10 times before, I had to upgrade to the platinum package I was told. I asked "why do I need to pay more for something that has never cost me extra in the past?" To which there was no answer, just more attempts to upsell. I hope the extra 5 bucks was worth it because I just want to get my car cleaned, not be hassled and asked 6 times if I want the detail now, in the future or 2 years from now. Relax and give the people what they want.
You guys suck.   Your oil guy sold me the top-of-the-line thing without telling me there was another option and then that there was a $10 charge for a filter on top of it!   And when I went to check out the check I did clearly had no sense of customer service and just kind of shrugged her sellers and said sorry!!    So instead of going to the closest carwash to my house I'll be finding another one.  Unless of course you decide to respond to my review and do something about it!     Ken.    714.328.4475  And PS.  Since I got ripped off I didn't bother tipping your wash guysi'm sure they don't appreciate
So I have lived in the area for about 3 years and finally stopped to get my SUV washed, needed to have it detailed since I just bought it and was sold on the deal I got. Brought my vehicle in for the detail.  Now my issues are the fact I had to go back and wipe everything down because they used so much armorall.  The carpets where still dirty in areas I had said I wanted taken care of.  And the dash was only wiped down to the first section.  And the detail guy held his hand out waiting to be tipped FUCK OFF GUY !  If you pay for a detail at the listed price you should get the service you have paid for.  I called back after cooling down and the manager explained to me that sometimes the carpets look dirty when wet I can understand this but when you see the dirt that you pointed out I'm gonna call bullshit !   Let alone do I want to sit down there for another 2 hours and have to deal with my car being a humid hot box while it dries again.   THE POOR REVIEWS THAT THIS PLACE HAS ARE SPOT ON AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST.  one more fun fact the windshield guy will sell you even after the first time he's tried and you have told him no.
I was excited to bring my lifted truck through their tunnel so I ended up getting the monthly pass.  The last two times I went through it the machinery was hitting the right side of my car and damaged it so that was a bummer, it did a descent job.  And they prep your car, half assely before you go through.  You'll occasionally get the mop smack against your windshield like they are trying to damage it or brush the back of your car and hear the smacking some more, they are aggressive with the mop.  The salesman like most say are a joke, they aren't as bad as other establishments I've been to, but when they have a line and need to speed things up, they just don't care...FAIL
Funny how I ask for an old change and they just decide on their own to put in the most expensive synthetic oil they have without asking me. I told them a Ford Explorer doesn't need synthetic and they had nothing to say. They told me my wife put in synthetic last time. We'll I don't know what you told my wife last time to make her think she should do that bit I know this car doesn't require synthetic oil. They were not willing to do anything to make me happy. Very poor customer service. Not a bad car wash but don't trust them with an oil change. I won't be back. They could have offered me $10 off the $100 oil change and I wouldn't be writing this. I would have said at least they tried to remedy the situation. But nope, they don't care.
Been using the splash pass for over 6 months, now what I get is not what I use to pay for. No more tire dressing with my monthly fee. They would not honor what was agreed to. The people up front who greet you need an attitude check also. They act like this is the only place to get a car wash. I hope they go out of business!
There is this word called courtesy and courtesy can really go a long way. I borrowed a friends car this morning and as a thank you for the favor, I decided to get their car washed. I saw a Full Circle wash and pulled in, I checked the Yelp reviews. They only have 2 1/2 stars, I know that people are picky about their cars so I gave them the benefit of the doubt.   Big mistake, there was a chip in the window that was brought to my attention, the guy told me that they can fix it while I wait and at no charge, I just need to give him my insurance info. I told him no thank you, he just kept at me, not taking no for an answer.   Now, I'm paying full price for a wash with some extras, I do not want to be hounded about the glass. I finally told him that the car was not mine, he starts acting like he does not believe me.  The pressure to get the glass repaired was offensive, the result of the car wash was poor, it was a very low quality job.   This place needs to be shopped by corporate, there is some serious management issues.  If I could give it ZERO stars I would.  Hire some neighborhood kids to wash your car, going to this place was not a good experience. Trust me, believe the bad reviews.
"For months i was buying the $15.99 Exterior super. It was the fully loaded exterior wash. After you go through the wash, you would pull around and someone would blow dry the car, wipe off the windows real quick, then tire shine all 4 tires.   It was an excellent, fast exterior wash that left your car looking awesome for $15.99.   Today i went and bought the $15.99 exterior super. Went through the wash like normal, pulled around for the last of the service and was informed that they have new management, and will no longer perform the last part of the service. EVEN THOUGH THEIR SIGN SAYS "TIRE SHINE" FOR THE EXTERIOR SUPER."  The description above is borrowed from a fellow yelper.... but PERFECTLY describes my experience yesterday. Extremely deceptive for customers who have been coming here for awhile. ALSO, when I pulled up to the ticket writers instead of greeting me with a pleasant "Hello, how are you?" I got "WE ARE ONLY ACCEPTING DEBT OR CREDIT AT THIS TIME." Absolutely horrible. "New management"= terrible experience= I will not be returning and I'll be sure to tell all my friends and family as well.
Holy cow this is a bad place - do NOT bring your car here or sign up for any auto-pay monthly service!  First visit did not clean bugs off vehicle and did damage to roof.  It was obvious just going through the tunnel that the systems were outdated and damaged.  Now fighting to get a refund and get my auto-billing canceled - they won't answer emails or and no phone numbers listed on their website (what a surprise!).  Lost the chance at a good new customer with four cars.
I know you work at a car wash, but put a little pride in your work. Car never gets clean here.
Got my truck washed and it's been sitting for 30 min. They still haven't touched the inside. I'm just going to leave. Don't waste your time here.
Well it's been about a year since I reviewed these folks and needless to say I am down to 1 star. This place has changed their packages but don't tell you they no longer hand dry on certain packages. I have stopped going here. For 6 months straight we would buy the 7.99 exterior wash + 2.99 for hand dry and we washed our cars once a week.  I wonder how long it will take them to realize new management sucks - their lines are almost non existent anymore.
After coming here many times with ok results for a quick wash, my Tahoe ended up getting stuck while inside the car wash (tire lost traction on roller) since no one pays attention the car behind me kept coming down the track and rear ended me at least 6 times pushing me thru the rest of the wash.. Luckily, my car was not damaged but the girl who hit me had damage on her front bumper.  The Manager basically blamed us and told us that "you girls will have to figure this out amongst yourselves".  They have no safety measures in place and if your car gets stuck you are trapped.  Not even an apology, nothing.  They were rude and disrespectful.  I will never go back there.
First time paying to get my car washed. Worst car wash. Pretty much just smeared dirt all over my car. Stains were left on my car. Defeats the purpose of paying for a car wash. Not worth it. Id rather pay more for a hand wash and experience.
The worst car was I have ever had. Outside and inside looked terrible. I had oil streaks all over the outside (I assume from dirty rags). Inside they only cleaned the drivers seat!  The passenger and back seat area was filthy. I was in a rush and since they cleaned MY seat I didn't notice the rest until I got home. The paw print, stains, and hair the was in the car before was still there afterwards. Don't take you vehicle here!
I have given them 3 chances. Gets worse every time. Exterior is ok but not great. Interior job is just lazy no pride. Will definitely find new place even though it will be a drive.
I've tried going here a few times because it's close to the house.  But every time my vehicle is either still dirty or has some kind of damage.  Today I went to have my new company vehicle cleaned because the dealership didn't detail it before my boss picked it up.  They wanted to charge me $100 just to remove the adhesive from the paint on the front finders and hood.  My company vehicle is a small work fan.  Plus an additional fee to wash the vehicle.  I went to another car was and everything included was less than half the cost quoted at Full Circle.  This was the last straw I'll never do business with them again.
I purchased the "VIP" wash for $20. They wanted me to drive my own vehicle through the car wash. WTF. Secondly when I picked up my car it had no fresh scent put in it and they forgot to wash several parts of the interior including the dash, the part of the vehicle I will be looking at all the time. What a joke this car wash is. Never going back.
Tom,  every time I go to your Queen Creek location I have issues.  When I go to the location in Mesa by Superstition Springs Mall I have great service and fill I get a good deal.
Horrible!!!  This place is right around the corner from our house so I wanted to try them out for an oil change on our vehicle.  Oil is leaking in our garage on a vehicle less than 2yrs old after going to this place!  Now I have to bring it to a mechanic to have them correct whatever was done or not done at Full Circle.  The car wash and interior cleaning was just as horrible!  I watched one guy on his cell phone texting almost the entire 15-20 minutes while the other guy was half assed wiping down the interior and windows.  I wasn't expecting much from what I saw in the lobby, and sure enough when I got home my expectations were met.  The back seat cushions were not vacuumed, floor mats not cleaned, door trim was filthy, and the back seat still had a dusty footprint from our kid which wasn't even wiped off!   I mean come on!  Is this place serious?  The owners of this place probably invested millions and it's being run by a bunch of kids who don't give a cr@p.  I'll never be back...ever.
Horribly managed.  Just waited for 20 minutes for my car watching one young woman clean the whole interior/ exterior while 5 other employees stand there and talk.  Not to mention they would walk over and look, get in my car and talk about it to each other but not help at all.
This was by far the worst "detail" I have ever gotten.  If you can even call it a detail.  The car actually looks worse than when I brought it in.  I came in for a wash and was going to do the wax and leather clean myself.  I allowed myself to be upsold because of the "discounts" the wash attendant offered me and the fact that it's well over 100* outside.  When I came out to see the car after it was "finished" I noticed extra baked on wax all over the place, bugs had been left on the front of the car and just waxed over, and it looked like no one had even touched the leather seats or door trim.  I asked for a refund for the leather portion of the "detail" but the manager told me that they couldn't refund any money since they already performed the service.  I asked them to do a more thorough job and re-do the wax and leather clean.  Unfortunately when I came back out, the interior was still a mess. There was greasy cleaning residue everywhere, yellow fluff from the bright microfiber towels they use, and the leather seats were still not clean!  In the end I just left after being told they are a car wash and not a "restoration" place.  Unfortunately they are clearly not a detailer either.  To make matters even worse, I found out that they don't pay their staff minimum wage and they are forced to survive on $5.25/hr plus tips.  Who wants to tip on service like that?  How do you tip the people who actually did a good job?  I will not be back and will be letting all of my car enthusiast friends to stay away as well.
Stopped in recently, but sadly was not a fan. The portions are large and their prices are excellent, but if you are expecting shaved iced, you will be very disappointed. I felt like I was eating crushed ice and the flavor was very watered down. The woman behind the counter was not welcoming nor friendly. There is only one table with two wobbly chairs outside, which we decided to sit at. Shortly after we went outside to sit, the woman behind the counter stepped outside to smoke, which we considered to be very unprofessional and rude (keep your secondhand smoke to yourself, please). Also, there were two teenage boys who were sitting inside when we arrived who, for whatever reason, decided it would be a good idea to hold a spitting contest on the sidewalk outside, it was disgusting to say the least. Unfortunately, we will not be visiting this establishment again.
Dr. Pierrend is an ok Doctor, he really doesn't investigate issues and is always fast to write a prescription. The real problem is the medical office staff. They tried to charge 2 co pays for lab results which should have no copay through my insurance. They claim it is an office visit even though the insurance says it is 100% covered. This was the final straw, I have had many issues over the last few years with the staff and as I said once you see the doctor he is ok, the staff is really incompetent and rude.
First of all I would like to say this is for the staff not Dr baldinado himself! I called in on a Friday morning to have my prescription sent to my local pharmacy. I was told it would be sent, nope! So I called Monday morning and the lady told me, oops we never called it in... Okay, I was upset but I went and picked up my NEW prescription and started taking it... After taking 2 pills (like the bottle says) I called the doc to make sure I was taking them correct, it seemed excessive for what I had. The lady told me "oh no, you're NOT supposed to take that until your healed"... What?! , then why on earth would nobody tell me that? The bottle says take until gone! Then she proceeded to tell me that they actually needed me to come in and prescribe something different...   I'm sorry for rambling, but this just seems so unprofessional to me... And to top it off I'm pregnant! Ide prefer to not be putting medication in my body at all but they said it would help me! PLEASE PRESCRIBE THE CORRECT MEDICATION -End rant
I have worked in the medical field for 10 yrs and I know it can be stressful, so when my husband complained to me about the rude response and lack of competency by the staff I blew it off.  That is until I called after my husband attempted to have his physicians order for durable medical equipment filled.  I spoke with sherry, who was unprofessional, rude, uncaring and absolutely incompetent.  The order was STAT, but after a week of playing phone wars with this woman,..we are no closer to oobtaining it.  She has hung up on me, raised her voice, made rude comments, and when I asked to speak to her supervisor she actually denied me and hung up.  I left messages but received no call backs, was told she would have someone call me right back only to find that the office was closed when I called back.  Out of frustration I was forced to call the main number and act like I needed to speak to the doctors physician assistant.  I quickly explained my problem to which the woman replied that I should be speaking to sherry.  I told the lady not to put me on hold, transfer me to sherry but just listen.  To be honest this lady wasn't much nicer than sherry.  I wouldn't take my pet rock to this place! I blame the physicians as much as the staff.  You can't tell me that patients don't express their frustration. Shame on the doctors for not caring.  Sherry?  Well sherry needs to work behind the counter at circle k where nobody really cares,...she would fit right in!  Don't go here!  I plan on calling my insurance company to make sure they are aware and with enough bad reviews they may not renew their contract.  I planon telling my reg physician so he wwon't continue to refer patients to this place!
PMG  Phoenix medical  Group. I will write a review in hopes that it will help someone with an elderly parent make a correct choice. I have a 78 year old mother who suffers from Dementia. I made a  appointment for  her to see Dr. Jerry  Arpino. We hade gone to him in the past only a couple of times . I use him for my mothers general doctor. I normally have specialist that I use . This appointment  was to have my mother checked for a  UTI . In the elderly  a UtI infection  can make them even more confused.  That morning my  Mother seemed especially confused I had such a hard time getting her ready to see Dr . Arpino . I started to run late. I called about 15 times I kept getting a busy signal . I wanted to let them know of the situation and that I was running late. I  get to the Doctors office 10 to 12 minutes late . Get my Mother situated and sign her in . I sit down next to her .  After a few moments go by  they call my Mothers name . I go up and they tell me that I will have to reschedule , I could not believe it. The thing that bothers me is that I kept calling . I tell the clerk Vanessa this she states that it  was high call volume.  Like it is a call center not a Doctors office. I made another Appointment  but canceled it after thinking to myself . I  always get the best care for my Mother ......and this place was awful . The girl seemed to be so happy telling me off .
I have to laugh reading the other reviews because I had exactly the same experience.
If you care about your health or your family's health, absolutely do not go here. I was cycled through three PA's during my time with this clinic. The first was actually pretty knowledgable, but fled the practice for the likes of urgent care. The second PA didn't know what planet she was on, and the third put me on medication I didn't need that made me horrifically ill. I finally got out of dodge and found myself a proper internist. I'd recommend the same for anyone considering this godforsaken clinic.
Was very unimpressed with this place. They kept switching doctors on me which I didn't like. I was also have problems with ear infections and they put me on antibiotics that didn't work, so I had to keep coming back. I was put on different antibiotics which also didn't work. Finally they referred me to an ENT.
this is one place i avoid at all costs! they almost killed me. all they want to do is to set you up to sell you their equipment. you will be lucky to actually see a specialists. all they seem to have is physician practitioners. i have gone as far up as their coo to address my concerns. she is even new. they are setting themselves up for a big lawsuit sooner than later. but why even bother... go somewhere else.   it seems like they operate like the chiropractors ... it's all about milking the insurance companies except these guys are  shrewder than used car salesman. at least they screw you once and let you go... these guys they keep coming back for more.    watch your health, your pocket. save yourself a lot of griefs and pain.   do more search ... avid the medical group thing... find a reputable dr.   good luck and best of wishes for you.
If I could give no stars I would! We have been at this office and the one on thunderbird both office we sat for more than an hour before even going back into a room! This is totally unacceptable. My spot was at 315 it's now 420 and we are still in the waiting room, 430 we finally got called back.
I used to work for an auto accident clinic in town and I would refer all patients to this firm for representation. When I was in an accident myself I immediately knew I had to call them. I had viewed their commercials and felt like they would take care of me as if I were family. I was in for a rude awakening. If the way they handled my case is how they handle family I feel horrible for their families. Hiring them only brought upon me more stress. They never knew what was going on with my vehicle and never fought for it to get repaired. A year went by, my case settled, they received  a huge check for doing nothing! As a matter of fact once they received the check they sent a letter saying they were dropping my Personal damage claim because it economically was not convenient for them! A year sending multiple emails, visits, taking qtime off from work and they walk off with a huge check and did nothing! They are unprofessional and inconsiderate. I really regret and feel horrible about all the references I made to them. Save your money and go to someone who will actually know fight for and represent you!
This people well take anyone case and play you in the end they didn't even fight for my case the dropped me cause they said economically was  convenient  they never called gave any information about my case they nver called me i called 10 times in one day left messages no response
We ate at Native last Tuesday because of their wing special. We walked out without having to pay for the bill. My wife and kids meals where over cooked and that made the chicken like rubber. My chicken still had feathers attached. Sick!!!!!
My family & I went here last Mon. for my husband's birthday. One to try something new & different only because there are not many other family restaurants out here either. We started off with cheese sticks (6) & the plate of onion rings (10), it was ok. There menu claims to be serving food made "Fresh & daily". So not true the fish & chips was out of the ice box as were the fries with a little seasoning to add flavor. The BBQ chicken strips were even worse than they smelled and served with a side of coleslaw and fries. The club salad wasn't anything spectacular either, a thin slice of cheese, lettuce, meat & three layers of bread along a side of fries. Finally, my sauteed mushroom hamburger, well done. Everyone else was served food & I had to wait another 6 min. only because I asked for a "well done" burger so this takes more time to cook than anything else that we ordered and was supposed to be prepared Fresh, I don't think so. Again this food was out of the ice box & had NO seasoning what so ever on the burger or mushrooms.   So dissatisfied with this place would not ever recommend this place nor would I take my family back there to eat, Blah, blah food. Just because the place is "New" doesn't mean the food will taste delicious. So over rated and so ashamed to even say I've eaten there but that was the one & only time I will have tried the Native New Yorker. Half a star only because the atmosphere is New.
Went last night about 9 pm. Got seated in the bar, and I was planning on trying an Atlantic Breeze drink to start. I was thinking wings too. After 10 minutes and no visit by the waitress I assumed they werent interested in making money on a saturday. It wasn't busy, I could see the servers and hostess chatting , the the bartender chatting with some other servers. Got up and left. I'm sure I'll go again though, I do love their wings.
If you're a fan of blue cheese, be sure to ask for ranch (and vice versa).  They will do their best to deliver the wrong sauce...every time!  This place is always busy but that isn't a reflection of the food but rather the desperate stomachs of San Tan Valley.  Service is slow/poor and management seems unconcerned and detached.  When/if more casual dining options pop up in the area, this place will be a ghost town unless they start focusing on better service and quality.
First time coming here and took an hour to get a burger on a weekday and after the first bite I find a long black hair cooked into the burger meat!
Waited outside for 45 minutes.  Then sat down at 2 tables for 12 people.  Drinks took 12 minutes and food took an hour and 10 minutes.  Food was terrible but the drinks were good.   Chicken wings were super small and the chicken strips were a dry batter and flat.  Only reason they were busy is because there are hardly any restaurants in San tan valley.  Cole slaw was awful as well.  Also when outside waiting they have no benches or misters.  And their was two pregnant woman there. Horrible experience i will never go back.
I have tried this location 3 times to make sure they got a fair shake. The food here is terrible and the quality is a shade of what Native used to be able to offer. If you want good wings you will have to drive out of Santan Valley. Try Wingstop or ATL and you will be much happier. This Native really seems to have poor quality and a lack of management.
worst experience ever!!!! We waited 30 plus minutes for our food, the waitress "kept checking", when the food finally came, my burger was over cooked and dry. I said something and she said do you want me to put your order in again? I said no I'm not waiting another half hour for food. She said she told the manager (which I did see) the manager never once came to the table to apologize, did not offer to take anything off the bill. She just handed us the bill and I said your not even going to offer to take care of my burger? She said she's sorry, went to the manager again and then gave us the check with no discount. When I left I told the hostess what happened and she said, yeah management sucks here, that's why I put my two weeks in. If the franchise owner cares about this business at all you need to fire the skinny blond lady that is so called "manager"!!!
We have been there 3 times since it opened.  Will Never go again.  Last Visit wad me and my daughter. We waited an hour for food and finally had to FIND the waitress who wad it the side door with her friend.  She got or food and it was ice cold.  Manager dais they could re cook it.  Really?? We just waited am hour, seem our waitress once and I walked to the drink station and filed my own drink! What a shame
This,is,one of the most disgusting restaurants I have ever eaten in! the noise Level and the.lighting is.like eating in WalMart. The Chicken wraps and Burgers are obviously filled with soy and cheap seasoning. my family And I,went home quite I'll after feeling like we had just been inflicted With a case of mild food poisoning. IF YOU WANT BAD FOOD AND BAD SERVICE THEN THIS IS THE PLACE FOR,YOU.it seemed Very dirty inside and quite unsanitary. THE BATHROOMS WERE  disgusting. this is not a good sign. do not waste up money or time. you will be very disappointed.I will never return!
I've visited this place three times, and EVERY single time, the staff is ALL standing around the front area... gossiping, griping about customers, griping about new employees, etc. It's very unprofessional and a huge turn off. Tonight, they were complaining about "the new bus boy" and how he "doesn't clean the chairs off, at all, ever". I even posted a photo of them standing, backs to the door, gossiping about customers.  Server: Nicole Manager: Brooke (or Cope? It says Cope on ticket)  However, a friend asked me to give this restaurant one more chance, so I said sure! We came here to use our laptops for homework and writing (we heard they have fast wi-fi), and the staff was very rude. They put us in the front of the restaurant, even though we told them we'd be here a while, and then they complained after we were here for an hour. The place got kind of busy, but there were PLENTY of tables and booths open. So to sit here and have to listen to them complain about someone sitting here too long (we ordered several food items) is absolutely ridiculous.  When I stay at a place for more than an hour, I always leave a huge tip because I understand that I'm taking up a table. However, when the service is absolutely terrible, it makes it really difficult to do so.  P.S. Their chips suck, and have no flavor whatsoever. Their wings are fine, their mozzarella sticks are great (photo posted), but the service is what's going to make me never come back.
Not at all impressed. A friend and I were recommended this place because it has fast wifi. We went there to do homework and write, and let the server know we would be there for a while, hoping they could put us in the back and out of the way.   They put us right in the front. No problem, it wasn't very busy, right? Wrong. Even though there were PLENTY of areas to sit for incoming guests (not sure why there were any incoming guests, this place is awful), we could hear all of the front of house staff standing around the host stand blatantly bad mouthing us and complaining that we were there too long.   The thing that most upsets me is WHY offer free wifi if you are going to bash people who use it! Furthermore, once confronted, the server then came back and lied when we had CLEARLY heard her.   Don't bother going here. The food is decent (I really loved the mozzarella sticks) but the service is horrible and unacceptable. I'm sad that I'll never go back because those mozzarella sticks were amazing! Get it together Native New Yorker!
I called ahead to find out if this location had a reverse happy hour (since pretty much all NNY locations do, but I wanted to be sure). I was told "yes, it starts at 10pm," so my husband and I were excited to go for $.35 wings (Tuesday) and take advantage of some cheap drinks and apps.We arrived shortly after 10pm, and were told that we could sit in the bar area, but that the kitchen was closed. What?!  That wouldn't have been something to mention when I called? It was pretty disappointing to get there, then leave because we came to eat. Can't comment on the food or service, but the information given when I called in was certainly lacking. The "lounge" is open until 2am, but the kitchen closes at 10pm? That's just lame.
This place opened up right across from work and I've gotten mixed reviews from my co-workers so I thought I'd finally give them a shot. I ordered a turkey club sandwich that was highly recommended. They all said that this sandwich was really big and tasty.  Well when I got the sandwich, I couldn't believe the size of the measly thing. I thought it was a joke. It was barely bigger than my Blackberry! I didn't even know bread slices that small even existed. The actual sandwich itself was very good with fresh ingredients but for almost $9, if it was double in size it would still be a rip off. It did come with fries but obviously, they're not worth mentioning.  My co-worker told me that when she's ordered the same sandwich before, it was much bigger and on Texas toast type bread. Too bad they started getting skimpy on the one thing all my co-workers seemed to like from there. They won't be seeing us back there, even though they are so conveniently located across the street.  They ought to be ashamed of themselves for charging that much for such little food. I don't see these guys being around for very long if they think that they can continue with these ridiculous prices.
I've been here for lunch 3 times, and have only had one good dining experience. The first time I ate here was when they first opened, and although they told us they were out of many items, what we ended up ordering was pretty good.   The second time I went was for takeout a couple of weeks later. I ordered a burger, which was supposed to come with "rosemary potato crisps". When I got back to the office, the burger (which I ordered medium) was extremely rare, and had some sort of sweet condiment on it. Rather than fries or "Rosemary potato crisps", it had been served with what looked like a handful of crushed corn chips. Meh For $12, I felt cheated.  Looks like they had a falling out with their chef, because they took his sign down, and put up a sign for a different Italian chef. OK I'll give the new guys a try. Well, I would have. When I walked in, they apologized, but the cook had just stormed out, and they didn't have anyone working in the kitchen, so couldn't serve me any food.   The bar itself has really nice decor, nice bartenders, a couple of pool tables, etc. It would probably be good for a game of pool or a drink, but don't plan on ordering any food.
Tried it since ive had it before on the east coast...wasnt the same here as what i recall. The store is small, the staff was nice and what not, just didnt really care for it. Tasted like a cheap snow cone and i really hate snow cones....custard was ok nothing to brag about. Location was pretty crappy. Wouldnt go out of my way for it but if i was near it and was in dire need of some sugar water id probably cave and get it.
First visit, amazing! Second visit, not so much. They are really skimpy on their servings. We said something to them about it, and they responded back with a snarky remark. They just lost customers.
Came on a Monday night, including our table there are only 2-3 other tables.  Variety is decent, a lot of different cut rolls, but half of them are some sort of variation with cream cheese. Many items from the photograph were no where to be found.  It has potential, but due to lack of customer, foods are dry, not fresh and salty.
Fuse buffet was a super fail from beginning to end. When we walked in they had taped up a sign saying that they had increased their prices. Um...ok we're already here so let's keep going. We were seated immediately and the food looked awesome. There seemed to be many different options and a lot of variety with the sushi and chinese and hibachi. The sushi variety was pretty good, very decent for a buffet style restaurant but the chinese was nothing special and the hibachi literally took a half an hour to get shrimp and vegetables. Dessert was basically nonexistent since all they had was a freezer filled with cups of ice cream with ice cream leaking out of the top. There was nothing that looked sanitary about that situation at all. To add insult to injury we asked them to split the check and they swiped my friend's card for the full amount and each of our cards for half too. He ended up paying almost $50 for his dinner! They didn't even inform us that they had made the mistake. I guess she just threw the double charged receipt away and hoped he wouldn't notice! For mediocre food, I'd rather go to a place with honest employees.
I have driven by this place for months and finally decided to try it. When we walked in the food looked great and it was very busy so I thought this cant be half bad.  This buffet had a lot of seafood and very limited selection of Other Chinese foods. The egg rolls and crab rangoon were soggy and had little taste, what taste was present was gross. Initially I was impressed by the sushi until I started to eat it. The fish was slimy and the texture was not consistent with freshness. In addition to bad fish all the rolls were very similar, avocado and cream cheese in every roll. My fiancé had hibachi steak which used low quality meat and used a vegetable mix that had green peppers. We eat hibachi often and never have we seen green peppers used. To top the night off we got our bill and it was nearly $50 for the two of us and we didn't have any alcohol on the bill. No buffet in Charlotte, NC  should ever be this expensive. If you decide to try this place, I encourage you to think twice and go somewhere else. The food is not worth the price.
Came here for dinner while visiting family.  - Food: Well, it IS a buffet. Sushi selection was terrible and everything was obviously not fresh. Hibachi steak was dry. My ice cream had freezer burn. + Price: Cheap for a buffet + Atmosphere: Typical Chinese buffet layout. Good for groups. - Service: Unprofessional. Waiters yelling across the room is not very pleasant. - Recommendation: Nope.
I never really have high expectations for Chinese buffets. I find that I never like any of the food. Fuse is no exception. There isn't a wide variety of sushi choices, and whatever I ate didn't seem very fresh either. Hibachi steak and shrimp was dry. However, I do like the system they have for the grill. Take a clothespin with a number to put on your plate. Just make sure you remember your number and don't take someone else's food. The only hot food item I did like was the buttered fried shrimp. It was the one with the most taste out of my entire meal.  Two new things I did see here that aren't at other buffets: make your own noodle soup and individually packaged ice cream cups. I'm indifferent to the soup, but the ice cream cups were a minus for me. There's only the 3 stock flavors of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. No toppings. I normally look forward to the variety of choices and toppings at Chinese buffets to make up for the not-so-great food.
This buffet is just ok. It's only $11 for dinner buffet for sushi, hibachi, and Chinese food. But the last couple of times I have been, the food has been cold and the sushi not fresh. And I've always been during peak dinner hours. I'm not expecting 5 star sushi from a buffet but sushi that's not fresh can make someone really sick. The hibachi is just ok. And they always undercook the veggies. The egg drop soup and the spring rolls are flavorless. And the egg rolls are dripping with oil/grease. The service is mediocre at best. How you fail to be a fantastic server at a buffet is beyond me. It also states on their website that they accept competitions coupons and that is a lie. They did not honor the coupon I brought in.
Biggest problem here is inconsistency. Have been half a dozen times, and 50% of the time your car is still dirty. Price is higher than most full service washes. They also have huge markups on air filters, in cabin filters and everything else they try to sell you. Example, in cabin air filter for $30. Went to auto parts store (which is accross the parking lot) after wash and bought one for $15. Basic oil change is 39.99. Danny's on gilbert and Germann changes 29.99. Both with a free wash included.  If you're in a rush, it will do, just don't expect a clean car every time, and be careful buying the "extras".
Oil changes are double the price of Fletcher's which is very near by. I tried using a competitor coupon and was denied. They are very overpriced here with zero chance at savings.
I had a gift card to this place and needed to use it. My experience was a good reminder on why I take the time to wash my own car.   It was about a half hour before they closed, abd bo one was there.We pulled up to the cashier and asked for the "VIP" wash since we had a $20 gift card. We also had a $5 off coupon printed off from their website. The total wash was a little over $30. I hand him the gift card and he wasn't sure what to do with it so he had to get a manager.  I then gave him our coupon. He was irritated because he had to cut the coupon. He tells me that he gets docked $5 for every uncut coupon he gives his manager. Really? Never heard of a business that deducts and employee's pay for an error on the customer's end. I could undestand if they were really busy, but we were the only car in line.  Sounds like he just tells people that to make them feel guilty.   So after the coupon and gift card we owed them $5. He runs my debit card for the full $30 amount. I had to show him my receipt. He didn't notice I guess. He had to do a refund and we were finally ready for the car wash.   It was an okay wash. The dirt was removed from the car. They didn't vaccuum out the backseat. And the workers in the detail area never acknowledged us until we left (assuming they wanted a tip).  They didn't confirm our order, didn't tell us where to go to wait. Very strange.
The car washing service itself is pretty decent, but just having to deal with the pressure from the salesman to purchase the more expensive options ruins the experience.  Also, avoid having anything to do with the windshield repair portion of this business.  They will say you need a new windshield no matter.  And they really hassle you about it the whole time.  The whole situation felt very dishonest and I have a hard time trusting that they have my best interests in mind.  My advice, go somewhere else.
I have been here several times, and I always seem to leave disappointed. Last time I brought my truck in they left a whole bunch of dirt on my car. Just took it in today and they left diet on my tailgate! They can never clean it right. I would suggest to go somewhere else. For $20 I expected my truck to be nice and shiny.
I am so disappointed. We went there for date night and I really was looking forward to some yummy shaved ice. First off, the packaging is plastic, so if you are into the environment at all (like I am), this was a real turn-off. I ordered two flavors in a medium size. There was hardly any topping on it. One of the flavors I got was cinnamon, and I couldn't even taste it, it just tasted like unflavored ice. I could have gotten some more topping, but it would have cost more. I really wish I could give this a better review.
Convenient only for those that live in San Tan Valley. Food is mediocre, prices are a bit high. Drink specials at happy hour could are a bit higher than the competition. Wings usually come out cold. It must be because the food runners are not on the ball.  Uncle Bears up the street has better wings, food and better service. But again, it is a matter of convenience for those of us that live in San Tan Valley.
Decided to take my wife and family out to one of the newest restaurants in San Tan Valley.  We were seating  fairly quickly, and our waiter came and took our drink order.  When he returned with our drinks he took our food order, which included so appetizers as well.  Both appetizers, potato skins and load steak fries, were still cold in the middle and the cheese on top did not even melt.  Tried to send them back, the returned food was now burnt and way too crispy.  My wife's patty melt came out wrong and burnt as well, she sent it back and the returned one was acceptable.  My wings were okay, but way too greasy for my liking.  The worst part of the evening is when the manager came to check on us and ask us everything was.  My wife responded "not very good", and the manager said "well that's good" and walked away.  Will definitely not be returning.
I've had a very good burger here but the fries were under cooked. The service on the other hand was horrible! It took a party of 3 (2 adults and a child) 25 mins of seated time before we even got water to our table. Asked my waiter for a 3rd set of silverware and never got it so I had to stop the manager as I saw her walking past the table with a few in her hand for one. Proceeded to tell her that we were not happy that it to over 20 mins to get water and we still did not have the appetizer and that I have a child that is starving and begging me for food as Im talking to her the appetizer hits the table. 2 mins later still talking to her and the food hits the table. All she told me was that they were having high turnover in staff and that it was very busy and if I would have sat in the bar area the better servers are in that area. UNBELIEVABLE!!! I should be able to sit anywhere in a restaurant and get good service!! Been to the STV location twice and same horrible service both times. My parents have also been there once and had the same complaint. Sorry manager that gave me a line of crap but I don't think its "busy" I think your waiters suck. Get better staff if you want to keep your regulars! Management brushes off complaints here and refuses to take responsibility! This location is much closer to my house but I would recommend the Power Rd & Chandler Heights location as far as service.
My husband and I finally decided to try this place yesterday. We will never go back. The food was not good. My husband's calzone was tasteless and too much bread and not enough fillings. I ordered a burger and fries and the fries were undercooked and the burger very greasy. I felt ill the rest of the night. However, we did have good service and the beer was very cold, but still won't go back.
Wasn't great service, food was mediocre, and the Calzone/Wings I had weren't amazing! Didn't accommodate my grandfather who is in a walker and the waitress was very rude about our situation. Wouldn't recommend eating here.
I dont know why this place is packed every night, but it is. Not a fan of their wings. Always too long of a wait for what its worth. Two stars because its close to home.
Gargle. Ahem. "This place was terrrrrriiiibbbbblllleeee."   I have to completely agree with the other reviewers that myself and my family were severely disappointed with the food, price, and service* at this establishment. My son has been begging me to try this place so we decided to grab some lunch there today,  around noon. Native New Yorker was actually pretty empty for a Saturday at lunch time and since it's still a fairly new restaurant that surprised me.  After we were seated we got our drinks and menu's accordingly and started to browse. Our waitress was attentive and very friendly so that started things off right and put us at ease. When it came time for us to order is when everything started to go horribly, horribly wrong. My son ordered the build your own calzone, I was trying to order the pot pie. And the waitress had this uneasy look on her face and she said "Are you sure that's what you want?" "Are you REALLY sure?" I said "Is there something you want to tell me?" So, she proceeds to tell me that the pot pie isn't made fresh and she really encouraged me to change my mind. Than my husband tried to order the full rack of ribs and the waitress flat out said he couldn't have it. The new menu's apparently haven't arrived yet and it's technically no longer on the menu. How hard would it be to strike it out? Or to let us know it's not available as you're giving us our menus? Not very.   After that disappointment and awkwardness we had to take another five minutes to look over the menu. I ended up ordering the native stripper platter which is chicken strippers with your choice of flavor ( I chose suicide and honey bbq) with coleslaw and steak fries. My son was able to keep his calzone order and my husband ordered a personal pizza with sausage, bacon and pepperoni. We also opted to order an appetizer, the chicken bacon ranch flat bread. To their credit we all enjoyed the app it was a little over board on the cheese but good. For six dollars we each had three decent sized slices.   We didn't have to wait long on our food and it all LOOKED good, honestly we couldn't wait to eat it. My son didn't like his calzone because it was too doughy for him. I tasted it and it was cooked through completely but there was definitely more bread than innards. And, when I say the ratio was off-it was off...my steak fries were not well seasoned and just lifeless on my plate. My suicide strippers were not hot and my chicken was rubbery. Overall, my plate was overcooked and just very bland. My husband's pizza was so greasy he had to blot it and the crust was mushy and he had one and half pieces and just slid it away from him.   At the end of the meal our waitress brought us boxes and she seemed to intentionally overlook the fact that our plates were still full. Than came the bill...after tip it was a whopping $50 ....the only thing we got worth eating was about $6 so...we won't be going back. The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because they had TV's everywhere all playing different sports which was awesome. Also, the flat bread app was good...  * The waitress was bummed out about everything that happened and it bummed us out.
I so, so....SO wanted to like this place. I literally live 4 miles down the road and it's pretty much the only place in the area with a decent bar. I also love supporting local businesses and want to see them thrive.  But alas, that hasn't been the case. Now, I can't blame the entire chain because I've been to other locations albeit going back a few years and I have friends that rave about their local store, so I can only guess it's the roll of the dice when you franchise, even at a local level.  To be fair, we've eaten at this location probably 5-6 times since it's been open, and while not every experience has been notably bad, none has stood out as a reason to return. That decision has been solely based on the fact that it's five minutes from my door. The biggest issue has definitely been the food. Several instances of receiving dishes hot on the outside and not-completely-thawed on the inside indicate that much of the menu is frozen and microwaved.....a common practice of casual dining I'm aware, but jeez, if you're gonna go that route, at least ensure that the food is heated properly. The wings, as has been mentioned is previous reviews are terrible. Flavorless, greasy, and fatty. BWW (the giant chain that it is) absolutely owns them on wings. Having hailed from a close proximity of NYC, I can attest that the pizza is not native of anywhere near there. :(  Service, at least after the typical awkward period when a new place opens in this bar/restaurant-starved area, has been admittedly pretty good, especially from the bartenders.  But that leads us to my final gripe, and what I feel would've been an easy way to redeem the shortcomings of the dining, the bar. The bar itself is simply too small and it's difficult to get a seat there, much less for two or more people. The surrounding bar area would typically handle this overflow, but they tend to just use it as regular seating when busy. I'm sorry, but when it's after 9 on a weekend night I don't expect to encounter screaming children in the bar area. If I wanted that I'd go to McDonald's. I've actually seen children AT the bar a few times when there was empty tables on the restaurant side......seriously?? In addition, the entire bar area is way too bright and could definitely benefit from a dimmer. I don't want to feel like I'm in a jewelry store when I go to a pub. Lastly, in this age of craft beer   renaissance, their tap selection is pretty pathetic, featuring (iirc) only one decent selection among a bunch of redundant mediocrity.   I do still have hope that perhaps it will improve, but sadly, it will likely take competition to make it happen since an ongoing history of negative reviews hasn't seemed to help....and in this area, it could take another five years till something else opens. For now, two stars for closeness and decent service.
Typical bar food except it's not very good.
Pretty boring inside and out, looks like a doctors office. The food is ok but every time I go it takes forever to come out. The wings are very small but good. Go here if you're into paying regular price for very small wings that look like they came from a bat or a bird not a chicken.
So I was going to give this place the benefit of the doubt based on all the other bad reviews, but they are right. This place is horrible. I haven't gotten served my food yet after a half hour+. Bathrooms are dirty. I pray to God the food doesn't suck as bad as the service!!  Upgrading my 1 star to 2 star cause the in bone wings were awesome! But a restaurant is only as good as its service! The GM should be fired and bring in someone who knows the service industry.
Went there 2 times we live a block from this place. The first time we went in we were there for 2 hours wings were cold and I never got my 2nd beer but waitress wanted to charge me for it. The 2nd time was much better but still not great maybe if we have a third try I will update it but I am not impressed for the prices the food kinda sux
I get a dozen honey-hot wings with extra ranch, and I'm usually gonna be a happy guy. They'll over-cook them maybe 3-4 times out of 10, but they tend to be worth the money. For that reason I'm giving the place 2 stars. If I ever get appetizers, or another meal, things get even more dicey.  The problem with Native is, when the food is cooked well, it's great. It's just never cooked well. The potato skins are fantastic, unless they're dry and burnt. The fries are great, unless they're undercooked. The wings (bone-in) are flawless, unless they're charred. The boneless wings are fine, unless they taste like a dirty oven.  The waiters/waitresses are fine, but if you're getting take-out, check your food first, because they apparently don't. I've gotten home, only to realize one order is wrong and another is missing entirely.   If you want to watch a game, and you're ok with gambling on food, this is a fine enough spot. They play every NFL game live, you might not be able to hear yours, but if you don't have Sunday Ticket, or you have an aversion to streaming, it's an option.
Wings were pretty good, everything else was just OK.  I'd be much happier with this place, however, if they showed the UFC events.  I've asked several times (in person and over the phone) and each time was told they don't like the UFC and don't consider it a legitimate sport.  Just about every other NATIVE in town does , as well as all their competitors.   ...minus a couple of stars for that...
Unfortunately I cannot give this location more than two stars.  I have continued to visit because it's close to home and the drinks are great, but the food? Absolutely horrible.  Each time, I have tried something different on the menu and each time I am disappointed.  The two stars are for the drinks and the excellent service I have received every time I have visited.  I just keep waiting for the food to catch up.  :(
Ordered 2 fish and shrimp platters to go. Both had limp fries, no lemon and no coleslaw. 2 pieces of fish and 5 small shrimp were tasting ok, however, totally overpriced at 12.99.
The food here is consistently good here.  The service and timing of food was unsatisfactory.  We sat down at 2:18pm.  Ordered at 2:40pm.  Received our food at 3:25pm.  When we asked for a manager - she showed up and wanted to argue with us on the timing.    This is when consumer personal electronics are beneficial.  Anyways, she took $10 off our bill and apologized only after we brought attention to the issue.
not recommend this place. they have poor service with high price. their staffs were not friendly with anyone do walk in, so disappointed.
Really crappy food,I ordered my favorite pork slider, it come on dinner rolls, soggy rolls. Where are the buns. Just really went down hill. Wings were over salted and fried dry. This place is banned from my family and friends.  Service was good. Food sucks....Food still sucks, gave it a second shot. Nah I'd rather eat Mc Donald crappy food.
This used to be better when it was native new yorker, but overall its your typical wing spot. Unfortunately I tried to substitute the reg grilled chicken with native style strippers on a salad, but just got the chicken tossed in wing sauce. The server was no help and should prob study the menu a bit more to help her customers.
Always went for the wings....not so much anymore too much breading and wings are just too big. Go back to the good old days of the 15 cent wing that had no breading and were crispy. Overall just too spendy for what you get.
Please never bring this chain to Northern California! The wings here are just about average, but nothing much to write home about.  The margarita pizza was just plain bland! Honestly I don't know what they could do differently to make it better. I feel like they warmed up a frozen pizza for our table.  I saw other entrees on tables across from me and I couldn't get excited about them either. Ugh I couldn't even figure out the theme of it was a sports bar or just a local hangout? I'll never stop here again for mediocre!
Service sucks, the food is very plain. I only get boneless wings after trying several other entrees, good place to watch a game
Ordered wings salt and vinegar dry rub and they tasted like plain chicken wings. We ordered a side of fries... $5!!!! Never again, I would rather drive to Mesa and go to the HUB for some real chicken wings! Service was decent and quick, but food not so good.
Ok, I REALLY wanted to like this place. The concept and cleanliness/ vibe is totally cool, but I'm there for the ice cream sandwiches after all. Sweet Addiction, I hope you're reading this... I went there with my chef boyfriend and we both were super excited to try their fare. After sitting down and taking our first bite, we both agreed:  Nothing wrong with the cookies. If you catch them fresh, they're a nice combo of chewy and crisp. Sturdy enough to hold up to a melting blob of frozen dairy in the middle, which I can appreciate. I recommended their visibly popular oatmeal-raisin, which seemed to be one of the lowest (if not THE lowest) stack in their cookie shelf.  Our major gripe was the ice cream. Boy was it... icy. I wouldn't call it ice cream but dairy-tinged sorbet. Seriously, it was watered down, not creamy, and just.. not good. I know there's some kind of cult following in random groups about Thrifty's ice cream, but if this stuff is it then... sorry to say, I can't support it! No creaminess whatsoever. It tasted cheap, watery, and we BOTH ended up sadly scraping the "ice cream" off and morosely eating the cookies. Like I said, we WERE both primed to enjoy their fare.   I'm from third world Asia and it didn't really bother me, but my boyfriend (the chef, with professional training in commercial food safety and cleanliness) was particularly worried about the cookie shelf, which is in the open air, without any sort of covering over it, high up near the ceiling. Very vulnerable to any flying bugs or whatever else may be floating in the air. Not to mention, prolonged air exposure is a baked good's worst nightmare. Sweet Addiction, we want to like you guys, but we won't be back till the ice cream gets upgraded.  P.S. I bought like FOUR Groupon certificates in anticipation of loving this place and getting a good deal... ended up using ONE certificate and contemplating using the rest for just cookies. We gave one to one of his friends who has a sweet tooth, hope he enjoys it more than we did.
Eh.  We came later at night so maybe it was an off-time for them. It was not that busy when we came in and a lot of the tables had sticky residue left on it from earlier patrons. Our cookie ice cream sandwiches were okay. Thrifty's Ice Cream is always bomb though. The cookies were pretty hard. I don't feel too inclined to go back and try again because the experience was pretty forgettable.
this place has a similar concept to a few places in California  for example:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/diddy-riese-cookies-los-angeles#query:ice%20cream%20cookie http://www.yelp.com/biz/cream-berkeley-2  I've only been to CREAM and it is 100x better than sweet addiction.  first of all it is more expensive than CREAM. it is $3.50 for a ice cream sandwich and $0.90 for a cookie. sounds cheap in comparison to a cookie at Mrs. Fields or ice cream at Baskin Robbins, but compared to the places in California, it is expensive ($2.00 sandwich if you pay cash and $0.65 for cookies)  2nd- the cookies were not good. the staff had said all the cookies were chewy but really they were borderline crunchy/hard cookies. not so great for the cookie sandwich experience. for a satisfying cookie sandwich experience you can't have a cookie crumbling in your hands after the first bite.  3rd- I don't think they outlined well enough what to do when you walk in. there is no "line" and the signs aren't that helpful. employees didn't explain anything or ask us if it was our first visit. after my sister ordered and paid she heard someone else ordering two different cookies for their sandwich. no one had informed her that was an option.  4th- got the praline and cream ice cream. nuts tasted old. soggy, not good.  positives: open late for that late night sweet tooth craving. fun furniture. some room to sit. takes credit cards with no minimum.  will probably not be returning unless I'm craving a scoop of thrifty ice cream
A little pricey and the cookies are hard. I don't really like how the cookies are uncovered and out in the open but the ice cream is good.
I love ice cream. I love cookies. Ice cream + cookies = love? Sad to say, nope! :(  A part of me feels bad because I have been to other ice cream cookie sandwich places that have executed this idea very well. I've been to Sweet Addiction few times. Two of those visits, I tried the ice cream cookie sandwiches that everyone has been raving about. Um, why are the cookies hard?? I tried them at night & mid afternoon - same result. You can't say that the cookies get hard because of the cold ice cream because the other places I've been to (Diddy Riese for example), their cookies are fresh, soft & chewy.   The thing I do like is that they have Thrifty ice cream! I will still go here because of that - just no more ice cream cookie sandwiches.
I've been a fanatic about this place since it first opened and have brought numerous different friends and family members to support this local business. I've also talked to the owner a few different times and she was always nice, but the young workers never were friendly. I just went after a date night right before closing, I showed up at about 9:45 (which I get, it's late and they don't want anyone coming) but I felt rushed to leave so I took it Togo. I bragged to my boyfriend about how much he was gonna like it, and he got a cookie sandwich with chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. Halfway into his sandwich he found a blondeish, coarse hair sticking out of the ice cream that didn't even look like human hair. I work in the food industry, so I get things happen, but this piece of hair was literally disgusting and made me wonder how it was inside the ice cream... Questioning if I'll ever return. Super bummed.
Love this place but with the new staff members this seems to be going down a little bit also would like to add i asked for a white chocolate cookie sandwich and they gave me white chocolate macadamia nut cookie now im not allergic to nuts but that is something I'd watch out for, also the cookies aren't tasting like they use to, also the new members  aren't  the friendliest.
I live for Thriftys ice cream! From double malt crunch to black cherry and yes the occasional bubble gum or pecan praline.   And I love a good cookie sandwich, a good chocolate chip cookie stuffed with Vanilla ice cream from the ice cream truck was always my first pick. But I'm sad to say that the cookies here are not for me. they are really tasty and good quality cookies but there not good cookies for an ice cream sandwich.   There to soft, to chewy for a cookie sandwich, when you bite in to them they just crumble and smush into the ice cream. theres no foundation, it would help if they froze the cookies first or uses a batter that made them less soft.
I will say I lovvvve thrifty's ice cream, and or a while it was super hard to get here in town.  So this place was obviously was a no brainer for me... so why 2 stars? On several occasions I got less than stellar service, I mean its kids working here, so theres always attitude, but 1. don't get annoyed when we show up ten minutes before closing, you're still open, and you're not making a soufflé here, I'm still out before you're actually closed.  and 2. Yes sometimes people want samples... 5 or more is abusing the system... 3 is making my mind up,, nothings for free, so sure i tip 2 bucks on a 4 dollar ice cream, and the server/scooper pretends not to notice...   the cookies are ok... not great... they are the soft, chewy, borderline not sure if they've been cooked enough variety, which hey, cookies are a personal thing.... but for an ice cream sandwich i think a cookie with a bit of crunch is better... the chewiness lends to a bite that takes a bit to get through and pushes your ice-cream out the back (insert thats what she said here)   all in all, best ice cream, lackluster cookies, shorty service, at a decent price.
I had been waiting months to try Sweet Addiction and was thrilled when my husband said we could go. I went to a similar place in Huntington Beach and was raving to him about how much he was going to love it, ice cream and cookies, how could it go wrong? But it did.   Upon arriving I noticed the decor and I actually enjoyed it, very modern and clean, and it looks like homemade paintings on the wall- tucked behind the refrigerator that is holding the soda and water. The smell of cookies was ridiculous and I was excited to start my cookie, ice cream creation.  I then noticed how small the ice cream bar area was and that the cookies were stacked on a self that was only about 2 feet from the ceiling.   After canvassing the place, we decided to try and place an order. Like I stated previously we had never been here so my husband was taking a little longer to order to which we were told to "step aside and let the next person order," there was one person behind us and she was ready either. When I looked at the menu and saw a cookie sundae" option it read "2 scoops of ice cream, one cookie, and hot fudge"  that sounded like what I wanted minus the fudge.   While placing my order with the tall blonde girl behind the counter I said "the cookie sundae please with ___ and ___ ice cream and ___ for the cookie, hold the hot fudge,"  to which the girl replied,"so do you want whipped cream?"  me: "oh no thank you,"  her: "so thats not a sundae, just get the 2 scoops and a cookie"   .....   Alright so yes, I suppose I should have realized that a sundae would indeed include whipped cream and fudge, however, I have been in the customer service industry long enough to know that you do not speak to a customer that way. I then heard the same girl speak to another customer in a rude manner. Then noticed that the male that worked there was standing between the back of house and the counter fidgeting with whipped cream and clearly avoiding with any sense of work duty-which always annoys me. Have some work ethic people!!  The ice cream was alright but a little freezer burnt  and the cookies were hard (probably due to the fact they are baked in the morning and left on an open shelf the rest of the day). I have to say that I probably would have been fine with this place if I hadn't first been brushed aside and then treated like an idiot. I also don't like the fact that no one that works here wears a  name tag.   Personally, I can go to a restaurant that has the best food ever but when the service and attitude of the people that work there is poor and down right negative, I will not waste my time or money to go back.
Cheap ice cream. Its for kids. Not worth the calories at all. Its rite aid  store ice cream (thrifty!)  Staff was working hard and very nice. We are super disappointed we splurged tonight and it was so not worth it!
I like Thrifty ice cream and never knew this place existed until I Yelped it. Very close to the house. Went there ten mins later after finding it and surprisingly it was busy and all the tables were filled; this was around 9:30pm. I enjoy my ice cream in waffle cones but they don't have that (what??). So I opted for the cup and got two scoops: birthday cake and pistachio. Delicious as always. Scoops were about a 1/3 of what I usually get (Centennial Thrifty Durango/215 scoops are HUGE).  Overall experience was mediocre.  Two stars because: 1. No waffle cones. 2. Small scoops. 3. Receipt couldn't be printed and had to be emailed.   I absolutely hate leaving bad reviews but I will adjust the star rating if things improve.
The Thrifty ice cream was not that great. The cookies were just ok ! You can just go to the store and buy some dreyers ice cream instead ! The prices were low. But i would pay more for better handmade ice cream !
Music was disturbing loud rap, not appropriate to bring your kids to. Place was filthy. Server were courteous. Shake was ok.
I was SO READY to love Frizzante, but I left disappointed in almost every way.  Italian food is my absolute favourite, but I'm not snobby about it. Give me a semi-comfortable atmosphere, a large glass of quaffable plonk and a plate full of that cheesy, creamy goodness and I'm as happy as a pig in proverbial. I am not hard to please! But Frizzante fell short of my very modest standards.  The first thing you may notice in Frizzante is that there's no obvious spot to wait at the entrance. It's very narrow, with the open kitchen immediately to your right. My wife and I hovered awkwardly by the door for some minutes, unsure what to do. The kitchen staff were frenetically plating up, not looking at us. If we had proceeded further inside, we would have been standing uncomfortably close to people trying to eat. We caught the eye of at least three different waiters several times, who saw us standing there and then roundly ignored us. Not even a "I'll be with you in a minute" or anything.  After three or four maddening minutes, a gentleman showed us to our table. Walking through the dining room you notice that it's VERY cramped inside. It's not a big restaurant and they have really packed the tables and seats in there. We were basically pushing past people to make our way through the room and my wife had to hand me her bag to fit by the table adjacent to ours otherwise she would have sent their wine flying.  The atmosphere is about as warm and inviting as an operating theatre. The lights are bright, the decor is plane and characterless and the music is awful. There is a set of huge mirrors along one wall to try to make the room feel less claustrophobic, but it instead forces you to confront the grizzly image of yourself stuffing pasta into your mouth and removes any sense of cosiness that the dining room otherwise might have had.  We had been seated no longer than ten seconds when our waitress was already asking what we wanted to drink. I asked if we could look at the menu first, so she came back maybe 30 seconds later. We ordered a bottle of white wine, which came in a giant plastic 'ice' bucket that actually was full of water with no discernible ice and did nothing more functional than take up about 75% of the tiny table. We were then harried to order so quickly that I caved to the mounting social pressure, panicked and picked a random thing from the menu that I instantly regretted.  So anyway, the food was not bad. Not great, but fine. My randomly chosen order was gnocchi, which was very salty, somewhat small and a little 'meh' but I certainly ate it all. The missus had some veggie pasta, which tasted very acceptable but really nothing better than I would make at home with my extremely humble abilities.  With so many great Italian places in Edinburgh, I doubt I will be back to Frizzante.
After coming back from Milan I still wanted Italian food so I figured I'd give this place a go. The restaurant is near the Odeon cinema on Lothian so not too difficult to find. I thought there would be folks eating there by 8pm but my friend and I were the only customers there. We got a bottle of prosecco for £23 and it was pretty good.   The menu isn't extensive and is pretty generic. You won't find anything out of the ordinary here and is pretty much just pasta and sauce. They did have gnocchi and that's what I was craving so I ended up ordering it. The dish was ok... Was put in a grill in tomato sauce with melted cheese on top. There wasn't much flavour going on and the tomato sauce was probably from a can or box. I guess I couldn't really be picky since it was only £8.  I checked out the dessert menu and it was pretty generic as well. Had some weird combination of sweets. I was going to try their tirimisu but honestly after I ate the pasta I said I better not lol... So I just enjoyed the prosecco and the company.   The waitress was super nice. She kept making sure we were ok and I'd say that was the best thing going on for the place... Well and the fresh cracked peppers lol. I guess it was my bad for choosing the place especially since I jus came back from Italy but lessons learned!
I visited Javal Brow Bar a few days ago for eyebrow threading and tinting. While waiting, I noticed that they move extremely FAST, spending 3-4 minutes per client. The older lady did my brows. They're not the same shape, she took too much off my right brow, and although I paid and extra $20 to get them tinted, I still have to fill them in and reshape them. I also dyed them again myself once I got home because whatever she used to dye them rubbed right off. I won't go to her again. The only pro is that the threading didn't hurt. I'll post a picture after I wash the brow filler off tonight.
I've come to this place several times and unfortunately their work isn't consistent at all. I happen to get their newest hire every time I go and I'm not very happy with he results I get. Every Time I go, even if it's not the new hire, I get home and find several things wrong. It's so frustrating because this is the closest and most convenient location to get my eyebrows done.
I probably would have given this restaurant 2 1/2 stars if I could have, but didn't think it deserved a 3 star rating.  The term "meh" definitely applies here - nothing exciting with the food, drinks, service or atmosphere.  The homemade chips, guac and salsa were all bland and the portion size was very small.  My sandwich and my dining companions' burgers were very bland.  Oh, and don't order the sweet potato fries.  If you're looking for a burger/sandwich/fry place you can find much better in Madison, or even Middleton!
The special costs twice as much as anything, and it's not so special. Good service. Nice outdoor space. Just don't order the special.
Three strikes and I'm afraid you're out. I won't be dining here again after tonight. The first time I ate here (a little less than a year ago) and got poor service I thought it was a fluke. The food wasn't great either but the atmosphere was excellent so I wrote it off. The second time I ate here (this summer) the service was mediocre at best and the food was worse than the first time. We also got seated in a huge room with no windows and where there wasn't a single other diner in sight despite it being the middle of the day. Lots of time had passed between my first two visits so it wasn't as though I had been anticipating a bad experience or anything. Months later, tonight, I visited The Free House a third time. This time the appetizers, main dish, and service were pretty unremarkable. The lettuce rolls were not rolls at all -- the plate consisted of an ice cream sized scoop of filling that resembled something akin to pink dog food and a dozen or so puny scraps of lettuce. I guess we were meant to assemble the rolls ourselves. My dinner mates (a strapping teenager accustomed to eating just about anything and a grown man with a healthy appetite after working all afternoon on a farm) exhibited no interest in that dish and ultimately we sent that plate back. The waitress expressed no disappointment, nor did she offer to bring out anything different. To her credit the appetizer did not appear on our bill but one can only wonder how routine that may be given that it produced no reaction whatsoever from our server. After we were served our fish tacos and asked how the first few bites were, our waitress again had no reaction (not one word, in fact) when I expressed my disappointment. The fish tacos (which both my partner and I ordered) consisted of little more than reheated, mushy, breaded fish strips with an excessive amount of thousand island dressing zigzagged across the top. Blech. I was able to get one of the three down despite not having had lunch today. In sum, while this restaurant exhibits some lovely exposed brick, wood panelling, a couple of nice bar areas, and a pleasant semi-covered outdoor eating area, the food and service certainly leave much to be desired.
I was looking forward to trying the Free House Pub and was disappointed.  The positives:  a very attractive interior, well lite with several large screen TVs.  The bar has a large selection of beers and full alcohol service.  The negatives:  slow and inconsistent service.  When you walked in the sign said to wait to be seated and a young man, standing over near the bar kind of just stares at you for a minute before you realize he is the host and you need to speak to him (because he was not approaching us).  We got our menu quickly (we sat at a high top in the bar) but the waitress never came back.  Luckily a bartender noticed the lack of service and came over for our drink order (and food because we had read the menu about 5 times).  The food was not to our liking.  The chicken tenders were food service quality and something I would expect at a dive bar at 1 am.  The roasted turkey sandwich was not turkey roasted on site like the menu indicated, but process turkey slices.  I see no reason to go back.  I can get a less expensive beer at many places.  I know where to get the best burger in Middleton.  PJ Alders has much much better tenders.  And I rate largely on service and honestly, both of which were substandard here.
Twas Sunday night and we met a couple of friends for dinner and drinks at FHP on a recommendation.  Our experience left much to be desired. Everyone had something to complain about.    They had a beer list which included a couple of beers that weren't available.  No big deal, it happens.  The waiter took our food order while half of our drink order had not yet been served.  We thought OK, well he's definitely not an experienced server, let's cut him some slack.  He told us the soup of the day was Beer Cheese Brat. The soup he delivered had carrots and chicken.  We asked if there were supposed to be chicken and carrots in the Beer Cheese Brat soup. He said it was definitely Beer Cheese soup.  When the bill came he later apologized and said that it was in fact Chicken Pot Pie.   Besides the crappy careless service, the food was incredibly meh.  We ordered the smothered fries as an app.  It was fries with cheese and a few crumbles of bacon.  Extremely underwhelming for a $10 appetizer. My girlfriend's Ahi Tuna sandwhich was gross.  They forewarned us that the tuna was cooked rare.  Totally cool, thanks for the heads up.  The sandwich was served less than lukewarm.  Gross.  It was served on a dry flakey bun.  It was disgusting.  I had the Hawaiian BBQ wrap.  All you could taste was the vinegar slaw which made up over half of the over priced, under portioned wrap.  My friend loved his buffalo chicken salad.   Everyone agreed that the place was overpriced and definitely didn't deliver. If it was located anywhere besides a rich suburb it would fail miserably.  I gave it 2 stars because of a decent beer selection.  None of us will be going back.
I've been to the Free House perhaps a couple of dozen times. My experience has been that they were novel and really pretty good early on, but have settled into ho hum west side mediocrity.   The food is pretty bland and some of the options at on the spendy side... $15 for a fish po' boy? I had the avocado salad and added chicken tonight. Decent portion of chicken... But it was more a green salad with a half sliced avocado. There were some garbanzo beans as well... but they seemed more a garnish than anything else.   I've had the last iteration of the the fish sandwich... Not the current $15 version. I was put off at the extra charge for an a request for additional tarter sauce...   My Mom had the prime rib sandwich... We often it rare... It came out a loud medium to medium well. It was pretty bland - albeit good for my Mom.   I really want to like this joint... But the service is spotty and the food is just sorta OK. I will way the beer selection is robust, they do serve late and are open on Sunday evenings.
The location's a little more convenient, but Bagels Forever is a much better choice for the three blocks. If I were to come back, it wouldn't be for the namesake bagels, which taste somewhat more stale or rubbery in comparison to their Madison equivalents. As for authenticity, and I'm not sure there are really "styles" of bagel other than big/small, good/bad, these are just neutral: not doughy or exciting, on par with or just above the kind of manufactured bagels you'd buy from a freezer. EBB does run coupons in local circulars, if you do need to grab a dozen or sandwiches from them. Even still, for the price and quality, Bagels Forever, three blocks away, is the way to go.
The room was comfortable and clean enough. But otherwise we would not stay here again. The entire second floor corridor wreaked of cigarrette smoke coming out of one of the "non-smoking" rooms. Plus the area and people were seedy looking.
I pulled into the laser wash tonight to get all the salt off my car, and I wasn't the only one who had the same idea. The pressure of the wash was just fine as far as I am concerned. However if I am going to pay $10 for a car wash, I expect to have my car dried as well and for $10 you do not have that luxury at this location.
I've been coming to this location for two reasons, good service, and entertainment from the bus stop outside.  However, recently, I've experienced not so great service.  Gosh, I wish the teens working at night would just pay attention. Two weeks in a row now I've gotten the wrong order.    First one last week, cheesy gordita crunch with chicken. I got a hard shell taco w/ chicken, cheese, and lettuce in it.   Bean and cheese burrito....I got a beef and cheese burrito. Maybe it's my east coast accent? I don't know.   Yesterday, cheesy gordita crunch with chicken. I got a gordita with chicken and cheese. Um hi, either you don't carry that one anymore, or the person reading the recipe does not know what they're doing?  Hard shell chicken taco encased by a soft shell tortilla w/ cheese between the two shells.  What is the issue?  I'm going to try another location until these workers move on to the next job.
I hate this location. Only here does it take more than ten minutes to get the one item I ordered. The staff are friendly, but they move at a glacial pace. If this wasn't right by my house I would never come here. I still avoid it most of the time.
I guess we had been "built-up" too much for this new restaurant on Greenfield in Mesa. There was TONS of teenage help, but the service was SLOW for as many staff as they had. My son wanted something else after he tried the Pot Roast sandwich, but when he ordered, it was wrong TWICE. I had to go up and find a "Manager" who looked to be at least one year older than the rest to try and straighten it out. It took some time to get it right, but finally they wrapped their heads around it. A LARGE amount of grab-ass was going on between the girls and boys and the young man handling our food kept throwing it in the window and then retrieving it again, just to give it a harder toss to see if he could get the lid of the contained to pop open??? If you don't expect much, you probably won't be disappointed. Very standard fast food and service. The sides on my 2 pc cod dinner were cold and not appealing at all. We didn't get ice cream, but hear that it is good. Maybe next time.
No the place to go for a decent burger.  It was worse than "Freddy's Steakburger" in that it was cold, plastic and lacked a upscale burger feel.  For the price, I would go to Red Robin first.
I thought this place was pretty bad - bordering on gross.  We went for the first time on a Saturday night.  It was pretty busy, a bit dirty (tables not clean, trash on floor) and the menu is pretty large and overwhelming.  When I finally got my three kids to tell me what they wanted I went up and ordered.    Wow!  For fast food that was pricey!    My husband ordered a burger and fries.  He then realized from the nutritional menu I picked up that the fries were not gluten free so he couldn't eat them.  I had a veggie burger with cheese and mushrooms.  I almost couldn't eat it.  It was the worst veggie burger I had ever had.  I also tried the cheese curd - a mix of yellow and white cheese, deep fried and they offered me packets of BBQ sauce or ranch to dip them in.  They were not good.  I don't recommend them.  The custard was the only thing that wasn't bad but I don't think I will be able to stomach going back to get it again.
2.5  stars the food was blah nothing special but the ice cream was good. Definitely a dessert only place
Wow... I've heard great stuff about this place and have been dying to give it a try. Well, I stopped by the drive-tru for my first time today and got the standard Culver's double cheeseburger meal.  I was soooo disappointed! The fires were just like grocery store frozen fries and the burger is without a doubt the greasiest one I've ever eaten by a long shot! I can't believe it is so busy with Wendy's and Carl's Jr. right across the street. Stick with Carl's Jr. for sure.
I wanted to like this place. They play oldies inside and I think that's cute. I dunno though- my meal was all fried and grease. Chicken strips and those cheese balls. Maybe if id ordered something else :-/ no urge to try it out again.
I tried Culver's for the first time today. I ordered the battered cod dinner to take home.  The fries were overcooked, the batter on the fish fell off when I picked it up, the lemon wedge had no juice in it whatsoever - totally dry!  The good thing is the coleslaw is one of the best I have had, but this meal was not worth $10.00.  Return business is doubtful right now.
Just once I would love to get what you see on TV. The Culver's fish sandwich  ads I was really looking forward to a great sandwich. I would have sworn that the fillets were almost an inch thick with a good sized bed of lettuce - sauce, but that's not what I got on either the walleye or cod sandwich.  You would think that someone in Culver's management would be responsible enough to at least show in the ad what the sandwich is really going to look like. Doesn't anyone do "Truth in Advertising" any more?
Ya, I can't get over the sheer hype this place had from everyone who wrote glorious remarks claming this was the best sandwich shop in the world. For $5.99 I got the jerk chicken sandwich and it was no where near as good as I hoped it would be. Ya, I can't recommend this place.
No wheat bread option!  And I don't like their white bread either.
The sandwich I have had was great (the Caprese). My issue is with the terrible service and organization. It is a disorganized mess. They have three signs, To Order, To Pay and To Pickup. No one ever mans the To Order register. You pay at Pickup and pickup at to Pay. None of the staff tells you this, so I've ended up in the To Pay line waiting for 10 minutes before realizing that I need to stand in the To Pickup line.  I don't know why they haven't just taken the signs down. It's not like I'm stupid either, every single other customer was also confused.   After you get your order good luck finding a seat in the Palm's food court.
UPDATE: So after I posted this honest review, Earl of Sandwich actually reached out to me. Something I appreciated. I As I shared below, I voiced my concernes and they apologized asking me to try them again. Because they are located in Vegas, it may be a minute before I get back out there. Nonetheless, the fact they reached out to me was a big deal in my book. I'll post my updated review after I've visited them again in the future.   Over-rated. Had the Chipotle Chicken Avocado sandwich. Very, very dry and my wheat bread was burnt. The salads are actually better than the sandwiches. Should change the name to Earl of Salads. Just sayin...
Mr. Earl........you and me got some talking to do.  First off, don't get me wrong, I like your sandwiches. I havnt had one yet that I don't like. My favorite is the Full Montague, which has roast beef, turkey, swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce. Hard not to keep picking this every time because everything put together tastes so good.  I like the fact that this location and the Planet Hollywood location is 24 hours. I also like the fact that if you sign up for the email club, you get a free sandwich on your birthday along with other offers.  With all that I said, the first thing that pops into my head any time this place is mentioned...........is the price. Damn Earl! 6 bucks for a little sandwich? That's without any chips or drink. To satisfy my hunger, I have to order 2 sandwiches. So 12 bucks for a footlong. Sorry, but 1 sandwich with chips and a drink aint gonna cut it for me.   So one size coupled with only one kind of bread. What's wrong with wheat for those health conscious folks? Sourdough sounds good too!  So Mr. Earl, I like your sandwiches, but I am not gonna go out of my way to tell every living soul but when I do, I will make sure to let them know about said statements above. It's up to them if they want a sandwich and if they agree with me or not. Please get back to me Mr. Earl if there are any changes based on this review. Until then, I will continue to whine any time your establishment is brought up in any conversation.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #3
I was not feeling overly energetic, so I wandered down to the food court of the casino to find something to take back to the room. I had not yet tried Earl of Sandwich so I gave it a try. The service started off poorly. I stood by the order area for some time before anyone even acknowledged I was there. After that they were reasonably friendly and helpful, but I almost walked away.  Oddly enough I did not order a sandwich. Instead I ordered the Baja Chicken Stuffed Potato. It comes with butter, sour cream, jalapenos and presumably chicken. I had asked for mine without the tomato that normally comes on it. My potato came out relatively quickly.  The potato had some good flavors. The jalapenos are a nice touch. The potato is good sized and filled me up. The issue with the potato was the complete lack of chicken. I am not sure there was any on it. I did not have it in me to go back down there to correct the issue.  My first experience here was lacking.  I will try Earl again, and will try a sandwich at that time.
Located in the Palms Casino food court, it's easy to spot and find.     I think it's called Earl of 'Sandwich' for a reason.  Their sandwiches must be better than their wraps.   The husband and I split the Buffalo Chicken Wrap which consisted of cold chicken, lettuce, tomato and cheese with the buffalo sauce.   Well I've had better. Much better.  I think I would have had a better chicken wrap from McDonalds and it would have been a lot cheaper. I was disappointed because I had heard many good things about their food.      The service here was ok.   She wasn't bad but nothing too memorable.     I really hope that it was just their wraps.  Maybe I'll try them again and order a sandwich? Maybe but I won't be rushing back.
Located in the Palms Resort, I would've loved to given them 5 stars becauseI have to say the food was GREAT but the service was appalling! The employee Maria was VERY rude, she seemed to be in a really bad mood and did not seem to want to work, almost like she was doing me a favor. I am from NY but I was very taken aback by her MAJOR attitude. Someone needs to have a chat with this chick! You need to tell your employees to treat their customers better because you never know who might be visiting your establishment, and you may just end up getting some really bad "press" ;)
I ordered the reuben sandwich (pastrami) which I already anticipated not being much of a reuben due to the absence of rye bread and corn beef. When the cashier asked me white or wheat I seemed puzzled to why it didn't come with the traditional rye and she just said it never does (it's ok I didn't expect her to know). My total came to $7.02 and I paid cash and had a dime to help her not break change. She became beyond confused and I helped her with the quick calculation of the new change due. I get my "reuben" minutes after the confusion I seemed to put her through, and it barely had any sauerkraut nor thousand island. Then halfway through, I noticed it didn't even have cheese! I usually love everything here but this was beyond a fail under the name reuben.
This place is inside Palms casino in the food court by the movie theaters so just park anywhere in the lot. My cousin told my grandpa to try this place. I love sandwiches, but is it that good to make a special trip? If we don't try it in Vegas, there's one in Downtown Disney, but we went exploring today and here I get to have my sandwich quest!  Got the Full Montagu and it was small and expensive not unlike Erik's deli (which is satisfying). It is hot deli meat, which is good (better than cold), with a cheesy mustardy Arby's kind of sauce. Wheat bread toasty Quizno style. I found nothing special about it and can think of Sprout's deli sandwich, which has more fillings and costs just about right... and I pop that baby into the toaster, which hits the spot! Guess compared to the other food court choices in the casino this will be all the rave. There is Panda express, pasta, Coffee bean, etc.  Service could have been better. I walked down to the lady to order and the lady told me it was where I was standing before, which now a man stood and she took his order first. Huh. Look for signs where to order and pick up.
Not nearly as good as the Planet Hollywood location.  I got the same Hawaiian BBQ sandwich but it just wasn't as good for some reason.
Hmmmm....ok, so everyone raves about this place. I'm a ways from the strip so coming out here was a journey. I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. Its been a while since we been there but I ordered the Full Montagu and my husband ordered the Club at the time. Idk, just wasn't as tasty as I hoped it would be, it was "okay." It was pretty expensive considering it doesn't come with a combo meal like chips and a drink.   This place didn't do it for me. But then again, a lot of people have good reviews about it so it's all on preference.
This location never has the white icing for the brownie cookies. I've looked on four different occasions during the past year.   The standard Palms card no longer gives a discount, nor accumulates points.  I got food poisoning from the potato salad here.
This place sounded great on the Yelp reviews but my experience was sub-par. I stopped by this particular EoS on my way to the airport for lunch. I ordered the half Chipotle Chicken Avocado and half Greek Salad. I was impressed by the packaging, in which the sandwich was wrapped tightly in sliver foil complete with an EoS sticker indicating the type of sandwich it was. Unwrapping  it was like opening a small Christmas gift.   Unfortunately, that is where the fun ended. The bread was actually toasted rather well, but the insides of the sandwich is where things fell off a cliff. My main gripes: the chicken was barely warm, if not some pieces cold (not heated/cooked enough) and the lack of avocado (about a quarter of the half of sandwich). Basically the two items that are in name of the damn sandwich! The salad was basic for a Greek Salad. No complaints but it wasn't anything over the top.  I feel like this place has more potential than this. I'd give it a go another time and try just a regular sized sandwich. For now, it left much to be desired.
This was our first time eating here and my husband ordered the original Earl Club and I ordered the tuna melt on wheat. In the end we were just not satisfied with what we ate. Felt something was missing. We added pepperchinis and Tabasco to spice it up but we would not eat here again.
My favorite items from Einstein's are their Paninis, but this location doesn't serve any!  If you like their bagels and beverages you're fine, but I was largely disappointed they did not serve my favorite item.  Also be careful at reading the directories when finding this stand, they say it's located in Concourse A, but I found it in B.  Get it together McCarren.
This Einstein is not smart. The number of mistakes they made on my order, brother's order, and a customers order is stuff a business can only get away with in an airport concession. I ordered a toasted blueberry bagel with salmon shmear. They didn't toast my bagel. My brother ordered a toasted bagel without cream cheese. They did not toast his bagel plus they added a bagel with cream cheese that they charged him for. When I poured my dark roast coffee another customer brought it to their attention that they gave her the wrong bagel. We were about to board a plane for Chicago and didn't sweat over the small stuff.    Obviously the Terminal B Einstein Brothers Bagels is not sweating over the small stuff such as their bagels. It leaves a poor impression on the business when they are out of sesame and poppy seed bagels at 6 in the morning. But they sweat over the big stuff: making a profit. The bagel with salmon smear and coffee that costs me $5 and a few pennies at a local Einstein Brothers Bagels costed about $6.50 here.     Two things save this location from my pending "Mad Check-ins: 1 Star places that Annoy Me" list. Although the employees need to be trained to comprehend what the customer is ordering and to learn to toast a bagel they made the wrong orders fast and with a smile. And the coffee was strong and favorable on the tadte buds. It is the same setup with all the Einstein Bagels where you serve your own coffee. And that is a good thing because if I was pouring it I know it would not be decaffeinated.      What this location has going for it is its location beyond security. Because their isn't much competition beyond the security gate,  especially at 6 a.m.; Einstein Brothers Bagels is in a position to charge more and continue to run a 2 star business. In the future I will try to leave more time so that I could have a 3 star or above breakfast experience anyplace else before a flight.
Located in the Southwest Terminal B Eistein Bros Bagels has a decent menu: Breakfast wraps, Lunch wraps, bagels, breakfast bagels, bagel sandwiches, coffee drinks, fresh juices etc.    There was also a pretty large staff on hand for a Saturday morning to make your food quickly.  Unfortunately the food and drinks come out scorching hot. My breakfast wrap and caramel latte were practically burning my hands and there was no way you could eat or drink them til they cooled down.  My wrap contained, eggs, turkey sausage, pepper jack cheese and salsa.  The wrap was supposed to have jalapeno smear, but it came with salsa instead.  The only thing I could taste was the salsa.  I took a bite out of the egg and sausage separately and they pretty didn't taste like anything.  My coffee was also very sweet.  Prices are pretty reasonable for airport food, but we will not be trying this place again.
Inside McCarren International Airport. This little stand has a little fridge to grab ready-made items and drinks or you can order at the register. They serve breakfast all day and offer sandwiches, bagels with shmears, etc.. I haven't had a breakfast sandwich anywhere for a long time and I don't know why I did it here... bored at the airport, I guess..  It was pretty gross. I watched them microwave the egg and assemble it.. I had it on an asiago bagel (you can choose which bagel for your sandwich).. I couldn't pick it apart and say I liked any of it. Not even the bagel.   I don't know if this is a reflection of what Einstein Bros Bagels are everywhere else or if it's an airport thing but I'm pretty much over it. I don't need to try another Einstein Bros to find out. It wasn't good at all. *Except those cookie poppers
Meh, I just had a cream cheese blueberry bagel which came out as any Einsteins should be serving it.   What I didn't like is that I went up and ordered with no line (sounds great if your flight is going to board soon right?) thinking it would be quick... Only to find out their were 6 orders waiting before mine! That's a little extensive for what should be quick turnaround considering you're serving people who are getting on flights. Okay, maybe I was being impatient? I don't think so, their were 3 employees and it seemed like only one was actually peeping the food which is why it was taking so long. One lady that had been waiting had to ask about her order and the gentleman apologized and said he would make it right away, as if they had forgotten or lost her order.   Not to mention, a lot of their stuff is over priced like crazy... Almost $6 before tax for a medium or large chai latte?!?! No way I'm spending that much when even Starbucks doesn't charge that much for the same thing!   Basically, if you've for the time and money, than it's worth a shot but nothing I recommend messing with.
Nah.  "Toasted" to this place means "a little warm and still soft.  Not crispy whatsoever."  Butter wasn't even melted.  Nor was it spread.  Just a clump in one corner of the bagel.    Bagel is sub-par to "real" New York style bagels.  As far as bagel chains go, Brueggers is far superior.
You know it's a classy joint when you check your bag at the front and are presented with a wristlet.  It bought me back to the Bronx with stripperific one time wear pieces for low prices. The $2 jewelry intrigued me and after scanning every plastic, neon, and gaudy piece, I was finally able to find a set with 2 wearable earrings (small fake pearl and diamond). All in all, not for me. I would consider coming back for Halloween.
I've never visited the store but I do shop on their website. My first pair of shoes I ordered in a 5 1/2 were way too big. I thought that was weird considering I am that size in every other shoe. Long story short, I wasted $22 and their shoes run really big.  P.S. I purchased the 'We Found Love" sandals.
This store is what I would consider a Safeway "lite" if there was such a thing.  Employees at the store have admitted that they don't carry the same selection of items as other nearby Safeways as this store gets a much lower volume of traffic.  However, it has recently been renovated (and is a very nice store), the employees are friendly, and unlike other nearby supermarkets (Walmart at 79th/Peoria or Frys at 75th/Cactus) this store is never crowded making it easy to get in and out with everyday staples.
Ok, we all know Mcdonalds is good for having to endure horrible attitudes, missing food and more attitudes when you complain. Well the first time I was right as usual lol! The lady who took my order was as rude and just plan ugh as she could be! I had to come back because she left out nearly everything I ordered. So I came back and she was like oh I apologize in such a somber voice and offered 3 dollar menu coupons (Take it they keft out almost 10 dollars worth of food). I took it and gave the manager a call the nest day and she was very apologetic and had me come in. She not only remade my order but asked me anything that I wanted and added it to it. All said and done I left out with almost 50 bucks of free food! So Kudos to them! Thanks!
I went there to get a frappe, it seemed like an average typical McDonalds.  Not a whole lot to expect being fast food.
Just like many other Ritas, but this one is kosher which eliminates a few products that are even advertised inside the store.  Only reason why not 4 or 5 stars is because of the kosher options
We stopped over while in Henderson visiting friends. Tasty flavors, friendly staff. Would come again if we were in the area and time was not a factor.   Three frozen stars!
This review is more about the lack of service than the quality of the Italian Ice I bought at Rita's.   I totally enjoyed the Italian ice and the flavors I sampled. They have regular and one or two sugar flavors. I tried the Black Chery Italian Ice and the Lemon and loved it. But, the 2nd time I visited the store on Sunday, 6/23/13 to buy a Mango Peach sugar-free ice for a friend of mine the 2 young ladies working there were not very pleasant. Every time I asked the person waiting on me a question she would look at her coworker as if she was supposed to answer for her... despite the fact that her coworker was waiting on a customer and didn't know she was expected to answer my question. They acted like working there was a punishment. I went around noon when the store had just opened so perhaps they were tired from the day before. I don't know about you but I still enjoy friendly and pleasant service.
The custard is not the best in the land.  The Italian ice offers a wide, unique flavor variety and is excellent quality, but I think I'm more of a custard person myself; it would be nice to have an equally high quality custard to match the Italian ice.  I am a big fan of the idea to combine the two.
It was OK, service was fast, the prices just the same as everywhere else. The custard was super creamy, but I dunno, I was just not impressed, my kids loved their Italian ice. There is nowhere to sit inside the store and the place is tiny, so if you go during the Mid summer heat expect to eat your custard in the car, which is what we did.
This place was okay, maybe because the italian ice was pretty sweet, but what am I saying, it's dessert, it's supposed to be sweet! The custard was pretty solid and the combo of the ice with the custard was pretty good. All in all, A-Ok in my book :)
after experiencing Joes in Cali, i was up for some custard. yep custard it is delicious and creamy, but wow EXPENSIVE! 2 large custards and 1 qt to go..$19.00! yikes 3 stars, service was okay, could have been more outgoing and informed, when i asked how much was in a large, 5 swirls...hardly 4.79 worth. 4.09+.70 for a spoonful of sprinkles quart= 10.99 wow!
Food was great! I had pear and pineapple ice with custard. Service was poor we didn't feel welcomed seems like the kids tonight were in a rush to close and clean up although we came 45mins to closing time.  The girl working made me feel bad about asking for a sample. She wasn't nice and really short and both the people working that night didn't even explain the menu to us or what's popular.
I've been living in Charlotte for 5 years now and the only relatively good buffet we'll have is Tin-Tin's (Can someone tell me why Greensboro has way better buffets than us?)  Anyways, the buffet size isn't gigantic although the interior of the restaurant is rather nice. They do have a huge amount of sushi to offer (which I love and was so ecstatic to see!) Other than sushi, they really need to step on their quality of food. Sure, it isn't disgusting but the crab legs seem old, their soups are too too hot (we had someone burn their hand badly from picking up their bowl).  The one thing that I could notice easily was the tom-yum soup. If you get tom-yum at a restaurant, you'll see how orangey red it is all around. However, with this, they used an instant tom-yum flavor (the ones you can buy in jars at the Asian supermarket). The red was floating in little dots in cloudy water with no flavor, similar to bad ramen.  I'll be back in a few months and we'll see how much it improves.
They have a huge selection of sushi but I personally felt that they all tasted bland. I hear they have good seafood on certain nights but unfortunately we didn't see any the night that we went. The rest of the food at the buffet wasn't bad.
It was great place for large groups. Had something for everyone, even the vegetarians. Since it was a buffet, the quality was not the best, but I would definitely go back with a group.
For the area, it's definitely the best Chinese buffet I could fine; however, if one is willing to travel a little farther, the buffet off of independence will really blow you away.    That's not to say this place doesn't have a great selection. You find food raging from sushi, just official Cantonese, and everything in between. You probably will find a few American dishes like ribs or meatloaf also located on the buffet. And the price definitely doesn't hurt this place, because of its affordability, I probably will return.
My husband and I LOVE buffets and have been on the search for a favorite spot in Charlotte since moving here.  We had passed by Fuse accidentally one day and made a mental note to come back and try it.  For $10.99 for a buffet dinner on a weekday, you just can't beat that price.  The place has a decent selection of Asian favorites including sushi rolls, your typical American Chinese dishes and desserts.  I'm allergic to shellfish and the chef was kind enough to make a salmon roll just for me, since most of the rolls had crab or shrimp in them.  That was a nice touch.  I have a weird habit of eating my dessert and then eating soup last.  When the waitress saw me eating dessert, she naturally thought we were finished and gave us our check.  Then she saw me eating soup and came back and apologized profusely for bringing our check too soon.  It was no big deal at all, but I appreciated how polite their service was.  Overall the food is OK, but the restaurant is nice and clean and not crowded so I'd definitely go back if I'm in the neighborhood.
We come to the University Area once a week due to my wife's classes at Charlotte Music School; unfortunately, I don't get to go to Fuse Buffet each time due to my waistline.  This is my second visit (which is a good thing) since there aren't many sushi buffets around town, and I do crave my sushi.  We have come an hour or two before it closes on Tuesdays, so it's never crowded, but I always feel like we don't get the best pieces of food at the end of the day, whether they've been sitting out or they don't want to put out fresher things despite kitchen closing at 9:30pm.  However, I do like the options for the price of the 10.95 dinner.  They have a decent amount of sushi options (no sashimi), mongolian grill style, as well as the typical fare of  soups, honey chicken, spare ribs, wings, and the like.  I wish there were bigger pieces of fish in their sushi rolls, but I can't complain for the price.  Also, the desserts are standard but a little lacking.  Plus, no frozen yogurt at the end, only the unappetizing ice cream in a small cup with those little wood tongue depressor spoons.  There's probably better Chinese buffets out there, but this one has decent sushi that are more complex than basic rolls.
Went here on a business lunch. and this place was just ok for me.  I am a fan of Buffets of all types, but this one is a "little" too fancy for me.  They did have a large selection.  And the food was good for the most part.  The Hibatchi station is a little on the small side, and it's too bad that the cooks face away from you while cooking because I enjoy watching.  The number system is a must since you don't have the interaction with the chiefs like some other joints.    If I have one bad thing to say it is that in an attempt to be more upscale a lot of the hot meat is placed on plates instead of in buffet servers.  While this looks nice, if the food is not eaten quickly you tend to have cold meat at the end of the plate.
How my friends and I stumbled upon this place was a spontaneous, unanimous decision. Even stuffed in 2 cars, we saw  "Fuse" dazzling on that street corner and forgot where we planned on going in the first place, but it no longer mattered.   I might be hyping this place up way more than I should, but it's seriously the best "Chinese" buffet I've ever been to. The variety of sushi that they provided was much more elaborate than the few normal rolls found in buffets around the Raleigh area. They also have a Mongolian grill section. Although this place is smaller than other Chinese buffets, the quality is actually comparatively better.   Eh, basically, if you're thinking about some Chinese buffet, and you're in Charlotte, go here!
Decent quality sushi for the price and amount. Keep in mind it's all you can eat, so your not going to get the "best" quality. It's good for a quick sushi fix, but that's about it. I ate here for lunch 2 times, and the food itself isn't that great. It's Luke warm and not fresh. I would like to assume that dinner is different, but I'm not sure.
I was on my way to China Buffet and saw Fuse so I decided to stop here for dinner.     Price:  Dinner buffet $12.94 without Snow crab. Add 8 dollar more w/Snow crab. Definitely get more from Seattle for this price.  Decor: I like the decor. Warm and cozy but for Tuesday night this place is half empty.   Food: The food was good and the selection was decent. However, some of the food definitely was out for a while, but this is a problem that plagues many buffets.   Avoid the Tom Yum soup, Ha Kao and Siu Mai but definitely go for the sushi. There is no Sashimi.  Some of my other favorites were the chicken wings, the Hibachi and the crunchy sushi rolls.   Service: When it came to cleaning up plates and water refill, the service was spot on. Waitress was polite and friendly.
Everyone is complaining how bad the sushi section is but forgetting at the same time its a buffet..Ur Paying like $10 a person so how fresh or exotic are u expecting the sushi to be...everyone's entitled to their own opinion but u can't expect supreme greatness for $10, 11 dollars...
Nice, clean buffet with lots of variety.  Been here a few times and will most likely return.
We found ourselves going here way too often because my parents are in LOVE with this place. This is your typical Chinese buffet place. I feel the selection is not as huge, but think that gives them more room to provide some quality dishes. They do have a better sushi selection and offer hibachi grill if you would want that. I also LOVE sesame chicken and general tso chicken and think they are #1 for these dishes in terms of buffet.   My parents love this place because on Saturday and Sunday they serve lobster and crab legs. Unlike Tin Tin, for the rest of the family members that do not eat crab legs you will not all be charge $20+ for your meal. If you do eat crab legs it will cost about $20 and they will continuously bring you all you can eat crab legs.
If was a random place to pick but the sushi was great but the hibachi was very plain. Needing flavor there. Also the outside made us kinda reconsider going in there but hey "don't judge a book by its cover." If the hibachi improves I might consider going there again.
The staff was very friendly but most of the hot foods were over cooked! Sushi was good and the customized soup was good. The overall cleanliness of the restaurant was not so good but giving that we were there late at night they might had not been able to keep up cleaning up! The women bathroom was very dirty!
Came by today at 12:15 and they were closed . Not sure if this place has since  Closed their door for good  as no sign was left but  the hours on the door said 11am for Sunday .. Hmmm  mystery . Please update business status .
They do an average job.  Sometimes they get very busy though.  I pulled right up last time I was there and didn't have to wait at all to pull into the car wash, but when I pulled around to the drying station, it was packed!  I think I waited about 40 minutes.  They seem to always have coupons on their website and I just bought a 90 day unlimited car wash pass off Groupon for $33.  Great deal!
My first time here today so I hope to bring my other car soon and will have a fair assessment of their service.  Came on a Wednesday at 3pm, there was only 1 car ahead of me in the car wash, and about 4-5 vehicles getting finished afterwards, so not too busy at all...  Was offered a special on their Full Service wash/wash/interior detail the wash was free and to come back and get it done later. I opted to just try a regular wash to start and see how their service was. I didn't get talked into any glass repair, oil change, or other services which is nice since I hear that other reviews were being sold such services.  I was told there was no need to tip any of the guys, but I did feel compelled to tip the kid who finished off my car, as I watched him and he did a good job.  Car looks great, especially since it had been about 1 month since I washed it, and I just moved/drove here from Northern California so it was pretty dirty and covered in bugs.  Inside waiting room was okay, felt a little warm. There was coffee, water, a fish tank, and some tv''s.  Note- my car is lowered about 1.5" and on 18"s and I barely fit onto the track, but once I was on it didn't scrape at all. They offered to hand wash it in case it didn't clear.
As other people have said the service here is hit or miss.  Like other car washes they try to up sell you other services and yes they have a windshield salesman there who tries to get you to repair any chips you have.  Just an average car wash but the kids do enjoy being able to stay in the car as it goes through the car wash.
I walk out to my truck after a long day at work.  As I approach I think to myself, maybe even partially out loud due to my spreadsheet coma, "WOW that is one dirty truck."  I notice all the bug carcasses stuck to the grill and windshield, the thick coating of valley fever harboring dust brought on by the relentless Sonoran Desert winds, the yellow bits of "pollen" the hardy mesquite trees like to disperse as said relentless winds blow, and finally the greatest gift given to a vehicle...the dreaded bird bombs.  I wake up the next morning and decide I should wash my truck, only one problem...I am not really feelin' it this morn.  I make a decision I rarely make, I go to the car wash.  Now, I usually wash my own vehicles so this full service car wash thing is new to me.  In the beginning all seems well, I ask "what is the difference between the works and the VIP wash?"  The reply, "The VIP is better" WOW, MOM.  Thanks for your insight, it was hugely appreciated.  I remember I have a coupon and show it to him on my phone, he actually asks me to and watches me delete it...umm I can download it again from the interwebz.  Anyway, I digress.  The wash went well until the dryer.  The air was blowing so fast that the hood was bowing and a piece of trim popped loose.  When all was said and done the manager did come over and put it back in place, I figured it wasn't broken and just wanted it snapped back in place.  When he is finished he tells me I should put a piece of tape on it so this doesn't happen, all the while I am looking at bug remnants in the grill of my truck.  In conclusion, I am at home looking at bug remains on the grill and for goodness sakes...there is still some bird bomb on the windshield.  While my truck is definitely cleaner, I usually do a bit better job in my driveway...at least on the grill.  Bottom line: The price was reasonable, the service and the wash was average.  Would I go back?  Probably not, i just won't be so lazy next time.  By the way, there was no attempt for an up-sale this time.
Went here this morning, a little before 9am. Not busy, and the car wash turned out great. Two things, just say no to upgrades, it's part of their job, but you don't have to take them. Second, the drive through car wash isn't the best, but the kids that finished the car wash, drying and vacuuming did a great job!! My car has black exterior which is hard to clean, and they went over it until there were no spots or streaks. Then they went back over the front to make sure all the bugs were cleaned off from a recent road trip. That was worth the $14.99! I wouldn't pay more than that--as the drive through car wash is about the same as a Gas Station car wash. But having someone finish the car and let you check it over is worth the money.
I've been wanting to try Sno-Ball Mania for awhile.  They are Baltimore style sno-balls.  I have no idea what a Baltimore sno-ball is but was excited to have a shaved ice place close by.  Took the kids in for a afternoon treat during spring break and we got cotton candy, bubble gum, watermelon and red velvet.  A small is only $2.   So good deal there.  Yelp description says shaved ice, this isn't shaved ice like I am used to it seems like crushed ice.  Def not the smooth texture of Hawaiian shaved ice.  Maybe that is what makes it Baltimore style?  It was good though especially when the ice melted a bit and you break up the bigger pieces with your spoon.  It became more like a crunchy slushee/water ice.  The woman who served us was nice but when we went outside to eat, she came out a min later and stood right by us smoking.  Why would you do that?  I have my little kids.  I thought it was unprofessional and kinda rude.  Walk down a bit, go out back, wait until we leave...something.  We will come back and try them again.  They also have ice cream and shakes besides the sno-balls.  Ask for a punch card.  Buy 10 sno-balls get a large one free.  I had to ask.  It wasn't offered to me.
Great refreshments! Especially in the heat.  Staff/owner/operator is cool, but don't expect a friendly greeting with a smile.
I walked in and was greeted right away. Owners were very nice. So I bought a watermelon snowball with marshmallow, and it was awesome. I am from Baltimore and grew up eating snowballs. Son-ball mania took me back to charm city. I would come back in a heart beat, and plan on doing that. Alot of flavors to choose from also. Thank you sno-ball mania for bringing some bmore love to vegas
It was simple nothing fancy. Wish they had mochi bites and not charge $2.16 for a scope of ice cream with your snow cone. Not a place to sit and chill at
we eat there a few times a month, average  food but usually good service. wings are good.
Good service but the wings are so oily. We used 10 napkins to squeeze the oil out of these things.   Maybe stand these things up and let them drain.
Well I have been to this native 3 times now first time was a few months after it opened and I heard alot of hype about it and the service and food was terrible, figured they where having a off day and gave them another shot and a huge fail.  This 3rd time we went to Don Pedros and I heard alot of good things and I wanted to do taco tuesday, Don Pedros is a waste the wait the nasty salsa bar and the fact that they don't acknowledge you.   I made a quick call asked if there was a wait at native and told the family we are trying them one more time, we where sat upon arrival, the waitress came and took our drink order shortyly after that she took our food order the apps came out quick and hot and not under or over cooked, main course came out and the burgers where hot and the wings where hot and perfect.  Our waitress was very attentive to our needs and kept the drinks full and never empty, I have no problem being that asshole and whistling or walking behind the serving station to fill my drink,   But spot on and we will return for another meal.
SLOW!! waited almost 45 min for my to go order. I was told it would only take 10-15 min.
Service was good. Ordered call chicken sandwich .when I got the sandwich they forgot the avacado
Burgers were great but the chicken strippers were tough and chewy. I would think that they would be better being a place known for their chicken wings. Not terribly impressed.
Native is your typical wing and bar restaurant. The food is average but the atmosphere is fun. TV's are plentiful and there is a different game on each one. Service is pretty quick and the staff is friendly. The menu is diverse and will have something to please everyone.
We went on Friday night and the wait was 20 minutes, which is pretty typical for most places on a weekend. Our server was pleasant. The food is always okay, but just okay. I'm always a little disappointed. It's just not outstanding. I had the California Cluck. I could make something better (and probably faster) at home. They have made their portions smaller from the past and upped the prices. It's an okay place, but not one I ever crave or would choose to go to unless my only other option was McDonald's.
Great wings place is always busy service is spotty mixed drinks always weak stick to beer..
The wings were very good. The pizza is definitely different than any pizza I ever had. They had towelettes which were pretty cool. The only problem I have was the wait. Some people ordered after we did and they got their food first. It was a good 40 minute wait I had to go through.
The service and food (wings, fried zucchini , and dinner salad) was good. It's a great option if you live in the area to watch NFL games.
Service was so so. Our waitress was very friendly but had a hard time keeping up with our table, for only having 5 tables sat in the restaurant.  To her benefit, we had a group of nine but it was a pretty simple order.  They have amazing wings and it's a great place to come out and watch a game or enjoy happy hour.  We will be back, especially for their honey BBQ wings.
Good prices, food is decent. The logo looks like a bootleg buffalo wildwings, but fuck it. Not there for the logo
I love Natives wings. The reason this place gets 3 stars is due to service. It really needs to be stepped up. I took a party of 10 here for the Tuesday wing special. After waiting 45 minutes, we were told that they were sorry but they couldn't handle a party of that size. We had to drive 20 minutes to the next closest location in order to be served. I've been back to this location since this happened, and it's been somewhat better, but it still has room for improvement.
love the chain in general, but disappointed once this one opened. service is hit and miss, food is alright. Will go as a last resort but usually go with other options.
Nothing awful and nothing great about this place. Decent food, decent service, they have all the games on..... not much to review. The wings taste like Native wings, the deep fried foods, same as all other places.... just decent. Good selection of a variety of bar foods. A-Ok in my book when I am in the mood for wings and dont want to drive far.
Food is great and staff is always friendly. We eat here often. Love the buffalo chicken dip so good!
My mom and my kids and I went there mid afternoon yesterday. It took 15 mins to get serviced. The hostess ended up taking our drink order because she said out waitress was busy? There were maybe 8 tables with people in them and 5 waitstaff and what looked like 3 hostess? Busy? Not even close! I think they need better training on efficiency! Food was Good. Can't go wrong with the Wings. Sampler had cold cheese sticks? Again better training on cooking order would help. We were kept waiting to pay check, so i just left cash with minimal tip.  I will go back in hope that maybe they day shift is not the norm!
The food is always good, but plan on spending a lot of time waiting to order, waiting for your food, waiting for your bill, then waiting to get paid out. I have no clue what the servers and cooks are doing that makes it take so long to get service.
I'm from New York and I'm visiting my cousins and they have been talking about this place and how good the wings are, So we went here Tuesday night and we was seated rather quickly. The first server we had was amazing even though we only had her for about ten minutes. I think her her name was was Tonya if I'm not mistaken, Then she came over and told us that Katie was go take over and that's where everything went wrong.So we ordered our food which took forever to come out, the asiago wings was extremely dry.By the time our drinks came out they were watered down because she took so long to bring them to us. From where we was sitting we could see she left them sitting at the bar. She barely came over to check on us, We had to flag her down every time we wanted something. The best part was the pulled pork queso dip, If I could give 2.5 I would because service suck but the dip made up for it.... I won't be going there again on my next visit.
My daughter and I went on a wed night it was not busy. We were seated right away. Ordered an app and drinks both came out fast, unfortunately so did our dinner. But our server was so good we couldn't complain it was obviously the kitchen. My daughters strippers were perfect but my wings were so over cooked there was hardly meat left. Not sure I would go back here with all the other options in QC now. But service was very good!!
Came here for lunch with my fiancé and MIL. Ordered the buffalo chicken nachos which were great, I really liked whatever cheese sauce was on the nachos. We then ordered 12 wings, half Asian garlic and half hot. The hot was pretty hot, I'm super surprised my fiancé got through them. I really liked the Asian garlic, I wanted to try more "Asian" inspired wing flavors since I had really liked a similar sauce from BWW and this sauce did not disappoint. We also ordered the special pizza of the day which was a 14" cheese pizza for $6.99. It was really soft and I'm used to a crispier pizza (especially underneath) but I heated it two days later and it tasted way better. Also, it was a huge pizza for the price. My MIL ordered 6 wings that I can't remember the flavor and a pound of chicken strips to-go. All together our order came to $54 which I thought was super reasonable. The food was pretty standard but it was enjoyable. Service was great, our waitress was attentive and polite. I'd probably go back during happy hour.
Sweet Addiction has been opened now for about five days and is a cute cookie sandwich shop reminding me of So-Cal's Diddy Reese cookie ice cream sandwich shop. The male owner was very enthusiastic about his product and very eager to serve you. They have 8 different varieties of Thrifty's ice cream and about 10 different choices of freshly baked cookies. Thifty's ice cream is sold in several shops around town and I was very familiar with the taste and varieties that were offered. I just came from dinner so I just ordered a baker's dozen (choosing one of each cookie). While the three of us were sampling each, Half of the cookies seemed undercooked. Upon holding it, it fell apart and tasted raw in the middle. Since they have been open for less than a week, like the owner stated they still have kinks to work out and many things to learn. While my friends and I were looking around w e noticed that a worker in a pink shirt was touching cash, then touching her face, and then touching the cookies and the owner was using his hands to place the cookies on top of the display. Remember with any ready to eat food, you have to wear gloves and once you touch cash or your face, you must always wash your hands! Overall though, with the great customer service and sweet treats, this is a great place to cool down and get your sweet fix!
I realize now that the main reason I like Thrifty ice cream is because it reminds me of going to the drug store and getting a scoop with my mom when I was a kid, not because the ice cream is actually good. (side note, Janel S says she used to go when it was $1/scoop - when was that, yesterday??? When I was a kid, it was .40 a scoop, and I'm not THAT old!) Anyway, back to the sandwiches. I loooove ice cream sandwiches and so I thought these would be extra good because you get to pick out your flavors. Unfortunately, even though they have lots of good-sounding flavors, none of the ice creams are that great. Second, a good selection of cookies doesn't really matter because they're all sitting out and hard. Third, the way the 'sandwich' is constructed, you can't eat it like a sandwich at all. The cookies are way too far apart and the ice cream doesn't spread all around. So basically, it's ok, but I had high hopes that the cookies would be good and soft (and I think they should be a lot thinner if they're used in a sandwich) and the ice cream would be delicious like I remembered. I drive by quite often, so I may be back in to give them a second chance.
Two cookies with ice cream, you can choose the cookies, and choose the ice cream.  They put it together and serve it in a cup.  It's good cookies, they're fresh, the ice cream is "thrifty" ice cream, but it wasn't way out there like what I've been told, so overall, it's just two cookies with ice cream for about $6, I think I could do that at home!
Weekends are when I look forward to browsing through my Groupons and trying new places.   After a filling meal at 808 sushi, it was time for a sweet. We decided on Sweet Addiction since we were in the area. The shop is pretty cute. It resembles pretty much any yogurt shop around town. They have a variety of options. Cookie and ice cream sandwiches, cookie sundaes, or you can choose cookies or ice cream separately. My fella and I opted for the cookie sundaes since we wanted to maximize our Groupon. I chose a tuxedo cookie and combined it with the black cherry ice cream. My fella chose the macademia nut and white chocolate cookie with banana ice cream. The best part about this place is the Thrifty brand ice cream. I grew up on it, but I'm really not going to drive out of my way for it. The cookies were my least favorite part of the dessert but are definitely made better by the ice cream.  Not the most inventive concept, but the end result is pretty tasty, although they could definitely work on a better cookie recipe . I don't think I'll make this spot a regular stop on my dessert rotation, but it's a good option in the area.
Soft baked cookies that are periodically taken out of the oven, Thrifty's ice cream being scooped into each sandwich, and an onslaught of choices when it comes to creating your own treat are some of the constants you can expect from Sweet Addictions.  The cookies are soft in the center and has a nice crisp around the edge. The ice cream is a staple for the nostalgic Thrifty's fan. I can see why Sweet Addictions is so popular with the residents around them because there isn't another place like it around.   I split a sandwich and felt fine after. Normally, I am pretty greedy when it comes to frozen treats. There was just no push to get another or need to horde the first.
We came on a Thursday evening and used our groupon (4 for 8) to get 2 cookie sundaes.   - Love the name! Creative.  - Cookie sundae =  1 cookie on the bottom with 2 choices of ice cream. Topped with whipped cream and chocolate sauce.  - Ice cream from Thrifty's. Average scoop size. A bit icy. Unique flavors such as circus cookie bits. I'd pay more for cold stone. - Concept has been done before. They have one in HB. Great that it's in LV! - Cookies are chewy. Personally, I think Mrs. Field's is better. Like the chocolate mint cookie.  - Nice decor. Owl paintings. Support small business. Good for a quick fix. 3 cookies for for 1.50. Need more seating.
I dig the concept ( in fact, little do they know, it was my idea !! I was actually looking at cookie and ice cream recipes for the same concept ... only better... honest ! )   nice selection of cookies and ice cream and the price point is excellent.   I hope this place can make it through the winter so i'll partake further in the summer months !
I like the idea of ice cream sandwich store, but not quite sure how it will last during the winter. The cookies were very good, but the ice cream was very sub par. It didn't taste home made, to be honest it would make a world of a difference if it was.  I had 2 white chocolate macadamia cookies with vanilla ice cream. I have had something similar in LA called Cool Haus, which is pretty much the same thing, but on a truck!
Did I go on a bad day?  First let me say that the ice cream gets five stars. Oh how I've missed Thrifty's, and Sweet Addiction has so graciously brought it back into my life.  The cookies are uhm.. not very good. I only tried two - the white chocolate chip macadamia and the chocolate brownie. The white chocolate was weird tasting. Barely any nuts, and probably too much butter because it tasted more like a shortbread cookie. The chocolate brownie was like a doggie biscuit. Hard as rock. It was really difficult to get over the texture.  I will definitely try it again, at least for the ice cream.
The ice cream was very good.  The service was nice.  The problem is, the place is filthy.  Trash can over flowing.  The chairs full of ice cream and there was a huge hair on my chair.  They need to send someone from behind the counter to clean every few minutes.
2.75 stars. I'm rounding up. Went here a couple months ago. Finally getting to writing a review.  When I imagine an ice cream cookie, I imagine two super soft cookies with creamy ice cream between. Though the ice cream was good, the cookies definitely did not live up to my expectations. Got sugar (or was it snicker-doodle?) and chocolate chip. Both hard. Crunchy almost.. I agree with Oscar R.- the cookies should up on display up at the front along with the ice cream.  Don't see what all the hype is about but I am willing to give this place a second chance.. maybe it's all about timing. Come in when the cookies are fresh baked and maybe they'll be soft and chewy.
I would like this place more if I've never had Diddy Reise in Westwood.  But alas since I know what those taste like and I know part of their appeal is to be super cheap, then this version just seems like a glorified copy. They are tasty but the price is what keeps me from going so often.
I would usually give this place 4 (or even 4.5 stars if it was possible), but tonight they only get 3 due to the service. It was a busy night but that's no excuse for an unfriendly staff and a downright rude cashier. We've been going here since they first opened. Prior to tonight, the staff has been great. But tonight they definitely looked and acted like they didn't want to be there. It's a good thing their cookies are delish, or I would be more inclined not to return.
I have to knock my initial review down a couple stars.  This last visit I was using the last of one of my daily deal certificates before it expired.  I got two quarts of ice cream each packed by a different person.  That's where I have a problem.  One was fully packed which it should be for the $6.50 price and the other was not packed firm.  Air was taking up half the space and I could feel the difference so of course out of curiosity I weighed them when I got home and a huge weight difference showed up on my kitchen scale.     Also, on my first visit I thought the cookies were good but in subsequent visits there is just no consistency in what you are going to get and in my opinion Mrs. Fields makes a better tasting cookie.  In all fairness I have never ordered the ice cream sandwich option so in that case when you are combining the cookie and the ice cream maybe it's so mind blowingly delicious that you don't notice that the cookies are a tad dry and lack flavor.  I've noticed other stores in the Valley now selling Thrifty Ice Cream so I may get my fix of double malted crunch elsewhere from now on.
This was a good change in dessert. Only problem I have is that you cant really eat it like an ice cream sandwich. The ice cream pushes out the opposite end when you try to bite into it, thus causing you to eat it in a bowl with a spoon. Not sure I understand this concept as its now ice cream in a bowl. VERY sweet. I love sweet things, but this was almost too much.   Will I be back? Possibly. If I'm in the vicinity and craving ice cream I'll be back.
Been here a couple times; overall it's okay.  The cookies tend to be hard in the cookie sandwich since they're surrounding cold ice cream. I tend to just order a scoop of ice cream now with one cookie. The ice cream is Thrifty ice cream, which is cheap and OK. I don't tend to crave Sweet Addiction, but if I'm in the area and want ice cream and cookies, I'll stop by.
It's  really good but kinda pricey
I'm a fan of Thrifty Ice cream, however it's expensive for a desert place.  It's worth trying for something different.
The homemade cookies are delicious, and so are the Thrifty ice cream; but I just want more variety in dessert.
A very simple concept that satisfies the sugar craving within!  Pick your 2 cookies and ice cream flavour and voilà = ice cream sandwich.  We visited last night around 6pm and the place was empty, as most normal people were probably thinking of dinner, not dessert.  I selected the chocolate brownie cookie and tuxedo cookie for my "bread" and the birthday cake ice cream.  While the resulting sandwich was not the best I've sampled, I was happy enough with my selection and consumed every bite.  My cookies were pretty fresh and chewy.  Hubby had a simple pistachio ice cream cone and was more impressed than he thought he'd be, given that it was "only" Thrifty ice cream (I don't have any nostalgic associations with Thrifty -- apologies to those who do!).    I was a bit surprised by the few (empty) tables that were dirty.  If the place had been busy, then there would be some excuse for neglected tables.  But we were the only ones there!  Also, many yelpers commented on the uncovered cookies and I have to agree with them: NV health regulations may allow for uncovered food, but it makes more sense to cover the cookies (from bugs, dust, dryness, etc.).  Just my $0.02.
today 10/12/13 i stopped in for a quick frozen treat.  my family and i are frequent costumers and LOVE this place!! but today i was unsatisfied by the service, normally you get a loud hello welcome, However today was not that day. also the attitude the girl gave us while getting our order made me want to walk out with nothing. I would have given sweet addiction a 2 star rating but the cookies were nice hot and fresh today so i bumped it up a star.
Alright, since I'm already not a fan of ice cream, I'll try to make this as unbiased as possible.  I came in with my friend and I initially planned on not ordering at all. However, they had some kind of special going on where you text a number and your ice cream sandwich is buy one get one free. So I went ahead and texted the number, and showed my phone to the cashier who told me that my ice cream sandwich would be free if my friend bought one. After picking out what I wanted (I had mint chocolate chip w/ mint chocolate cookies), and after my friend pays for his, we were about to walk out.  Suddenly the cashier yells, "So which one of you is paying for that?"  Are you serious? Your promotion says it was free and you JUST told me it would be free. Buy one get one free right? My friend bought one. We get one free, right?  I didn't carry any money on me, which is why I wasn't planning on getting anything in the first place. My friend ended up paying for two, and I had to pay him back later. As he was paying the cashier (a guy) was eyeing us down the whole time like we were thieves.  If their ice cream was not exceptional, I would have given this place 1 star. 3 stars for the ice cream, nothing else.
My daughter wanted Ice Creme Saturday and I remembered a sign for Thrifty, (my Favorite) The place was busy, One person working the counter and a guy standing in the back looking at customers.. Here is the good,,, The cookies and Ice cream are top notch, the 3.50 price tag wasn't even scarey.      The Bad..  I didnt care for the lack of service and I really didnt like the chairs being grimy, not just dirty.  The wall is missing paint and there are shoe and heel marks all over the wall at the base as well. More effort needs to go into cleaning the front of the house, because it clearly sends a message to customers that it may be that dirty in the back of the house..
Goodbye waistline......  And that sums it up!!! This business is not for the faint hearted. The name could not be more spot on, Sweet Addiction, Cookies and Ice Cream, not to be confused with Janes Addiction as my other yelpers HH and RM tried to confuse me.  Located in a regular strip mall next to a few unusual 20 something stores, just on South Apache and West Reno Ave. It is not hard to miss this place with a pretty easy to read sign out front.  Shakes, flavored milk, ice cream products are all served here, but the main attraction is the cookie sandwiches. Ordering a customized sandwich to for fill any sweet toothed at heart.  Going with the rocky road ice cream with m&m's cookie on one side and the chocolate cookie on the other, I truly believe that this would satisfy my inner fatboy! Unfortunately it wasn't to be. Although a interesting concept and half decent ice cream, I felt like this business missed the mark and went a little overkill. The cookies were not as fresh as I thought and the ice cream was run of the mill.  Although this place is unique, I feel now ive been there and done that. Nothing really grabbed me to say come back other than the day I feel I need to eat my feelings.  Overall  Cleanliness: 3-5 Price: $ Food: 3-4 Back again: Nope (that's a lie, if friends want to come here I can't stop them)
What could go wrong with cookies and ice cream?! Well, nothing, actually. The combination is so simply delightful that there isn't much effort required... or received.  Male staff present was friendly, female was bored and disinterested. BF and I got two different cookie sandwiches and both were okay, but nothing more than cookies and ice cream. Tuxedo cookies were tasty and chewy, mocha almond fudge ice cream was decent. BF got two different cookies and the mint chocolate ice cream, and it was also solid.  Cookies were out in open air, uncovered, which was a little odd. Would think that would be against health code but I guess not. Cookie was mashed into bottom of bowl, topped with a scoop, and closed with another cookie- not quite what I pictured but what was necessary given the size of the assembled dessert.  I appreciated the variety of flavor combinations that could be customized with different cookies (or getting two different ones) and ice cream flavors. Portion was gigantic and we easily could have split one instead of having our own. Pricing was fair for the portion, but I liked that they have a text offer to get $1 off, bringing our total to under $7.  In short, cookies + ice cream is a no-brainer but more work needs to be put into the execution of this basic idea.
I'm pretty basic when it comes to ice cream. And a chocolate chip/snickerdoodle cookie vanilla ice cream sandwich is all it takes to make my tummy happy! Their ice cream is thrifty's. Who doesn't love thrifty's?! Their cookies are nice and chewy, and definitely not hard as a rock. Every time I come here I get good service. Have to get a water bottle while you're at it, they don't call it SWEET addiction for nothing. Definitely wish they had punch cards here. Always a favorite place to stop by in the Vegas heat!  Edited: There was hair in my ice cream sandwich for my latest visit. I lost my appetite and was disgusted.
The ice cream is fantastic (THRIFTY) and the cookies are good. But I couldn't easily maneuver the sandwich thing.   Thrifty ice cream is one if my favorites. Like a few others, I grew up eating the stuff as a kid. But it's so specific, I don't know if most of the flavors lend themselves to the complication of a sandwich.  It's not gourmet, and maybe that's the problem. It's a simple ice cream that doesn't offer much depth for a modern ice cream sandwich. If I go back, I'll probably get a simple vanilla with a brownie cookie.   Speaking if cookies, the cookies were soft and sweet, but I ended up eating my cookies and ice cream separately. My ice cream was too soft to hold up to the sandwich expectation and I didn't want it to melt while I was busy trying to work it out.    I like the idea of this place and I think using Thrifty ice cream makes sense in terms of its popularity and nostalgia factor.
Dude ...  Have they always had milkshakes?   These things are sooooooooo good!  Fucking aye.   I still prefer the white chocolate macadamia nut with coconut ice cream. Now, I can just drink it. (Chalk it up to the islander in me.)   They need straws with a larger circumference. Those tiny red straws ain't gonna cut, bud.
Not sure what all the 5 stars are about.  Went here based on Yelp reviews, which I must say I was disappointed in.  The service was excellent.  The young lady that helped us was very friendly, offered samples and explained the menu.  The ice cream is not homemade.  It is Thrifty brand.  They have at least 20 flavor options.  The samples I tried had a freezer burn aftertaste.  I ended up with the grasshopper sundae, which on Sunday's is only $3.50.  They run a daily special and Sunday's special happened to be $2 off any sundae.  The sundae consisted of 2 huge scoops of mint chocolate chip, a small brownie cookie, a drizzle of chocolate sauce, a huge healing of whipped cream and a few chocolate shavings.  It was ok, but definitely didn't set my taste buds on fire. I tried an M&M cookie and while it was ok, the overall impression it left was just that "ok".  The store itself seemed outdated and in need of a good cleaning.  I think I will move on and try another Vegas option next time I have a hankering for some scream, ice cream that is!
The ice cream sandwich was delicious but the service made me feel rushed and not feel welcomed I will keep coming but I will have to know what I want before walking in!!!!
So, for divine ice cream cookie sandwiches you need some bomb cookies and good ice cream.  I wasn't too ecstatic about the cookies here. And so maybe that's why it's an average star for me. I ordered a shake and did the wrong thing by cutting down the ice cream amount they put in the shake to half. I thought they'd adjust the milk with it, but maybe not, so my shake was mehhhh.   I'll still come back and give this place another shot.
Came back here to give it a second shot. We got one animal cookie ice cream with brownie cookie sandwich. Yummy.  Also got the chocolate malt crunch cuz this used to be my go-to thrifty's ice cream when rite aid sold them. I also tried 4 different cookies.   Oatmeal was good, and the rest were okay. I want to say that it's not the best ice cream or cookies I've ever had in my life, but good enough to curb your sweet tooth if in dire need of dessert.   Service was awesome. I hope they clean the chairs more because it's either permanently stained in brown, or dirt infested from some child stomping with their muddy shoes. I didn't bother to try the finger wipe test because I was too scared to find out.
AMAZING ice cream sandwiches with fresh cookies, and Thrifty ice cream.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE at this location!  Every time I go, I swear it will be the last because the employees are just devoid of customer service skills, are appallingly apathetic or make excuses for their lack of customer service.  I've even tried to contact the owner, but he/she can't be bothered.  A message was relayed back to me, which did not answer my question, probably because the apathetic employee who relayed the message wasn't listening.  If you want a yummy ice cream sandwich drive to the Sweet Addiction in Green Valley.  The service has ALWAYS been fantastic.
3.5 stars! Nice selection of ice cream flavors, not too overwhelming. I love how the cookies are soft! Most places I've been to that do ice cream cookie sandwiches use cookies that are firm, which I think makes it difficult to eat.  As for experience- the shop was rather hot and stuffy which make it uncomfortable to sit and eat inside. Unfortunately outside there was only 1 table with 2 chairs.
The ice cream and service is great, but unfortunately the place is filthy, which is a big turn off for me!
This place is really just okay. For lack of better threading salons, this place will suffice. The older lady that has threaded my eyebrows does a good job, but I don't think it's thorough enough. She does a good job, but not a "clean" job. Many threading salons that I have been to trim your brow hairs as well as thread them...not this place! With this place, she does give you a natural shape but I still see little hairs that were not picked up. Plus, the last time I came here, one eyebrow was threaded thinner than the other :(. Is Javal the best? Certainly not. But, for what's available in the area, it's a decent place.  I do love the little massage she gives on your temples and brows, though! :D
Went here since it was close to my house and my normal threader was not working at her brow bar.   The older lady did my eyebrows, lip and chin and though it was an okay job... It was not great.  The threading was not super clean and she kinda changed the shape of my left brow. Not to mention I broke out on my upper lip the day after which I never have done in 4 years of being threaded  In a pinch I would probably return but would not choose here as my first choice.
okay service was very quick but I noticed they didn't pay attention to what I wanted overall I've had better experiences elsewhere, but would go back if needed
Went here last night for my birthday dinner. The wait was about 45 min, which is fine we like to have a drink at the bar before we eat most times anyways. The bar was nice and big, great choices for local/WI beers and microbreweries. Cocktails were also reasonably priced. I should say that the bartenders were super nice and friendly. We ordered a simple appetizer of chips and salsa, took a very very long time. The bartender said the ticket got lost. The bartender took care of a drink and the app on our tab which was very nice and unexpected.   The menu however was underwhelming. A little pricey for what looked like a very small burger patty (I would guess 1/4 lb) They also do not have dessert on the menu and being my birthday I wanted something sweet. We decided to skip dinner and go to an Italian restaurant down the street.   I think for drinks we will prob be back; it was a fun and inviting atmosphere and bar service was great aside from the very late appetizer which really wasn't their fault. Maybe we'll try the food sometime if they jazz up the menu a bit.
Free House is located around a growing restaurant cluster around Parmenter St in Middleton in the old Forrestal's Gallery.  The building is historic and has been home to many former businesses - the building dates to the 1800s.   Free House's beer, cocktail, and separate whiskey menu are extensive.  This explains the crowded bar area in the entryway around happy hour on my visit.  The food attempts to match other local upscale bar food (The Great Dane, The Laurel Tavern, Coopers Tavern).  Granted, the crowds I've seen here are mainly divided into the bar group and families with children in the dining area and neither are likely going to demand fussy hipster ingredients.  Chicken fingers, a standard burger, and grilled cheese are all available.  The restaurant does have sweet potato fries, parmesean fries, and a homemade vegetarian chili, though, so it's not exactly a country dive bar, either.  As a vegetarian, I appreciated the availability of a veggie burger made in-house.  I had mine with a side of greens.  It was fairly good, though needed some sort of additional moisture from sauce or veggies.  My friend's "Big Tex" burger was loaded with sauce and needed to be cut in half to avoid a BBQ fashion emergency.  The goat cheese beet salad and fish fry special (on a Wednesday night, no less) at the neighboring table looked like good bets for next time.  Service is quick and prices are reasonable.  The decor is probably a work in progress but I'm guessing with time they'll bring the current "rec room chic" up a level or two.
Positives:  The bacon & blue burger with fresh greens and grainy bun for 50 cents more was very tasty;   the beer selection is thoughtful;  the situation and decor is pleasant-breezy-suburban plus aspiring;  the staff are smart, hard-working, sharp people.  Negatives:  Beer prices are kind of high;  the Gulden Draak was great but the Capital Maibock reeked of buttery/skanky uncleaned line - - no way will I go back for a casual and overpriced brew under dubious quality control;  ueber-commercial and pretentious feel to the operation, for better or worse;   you are likely paying for slickness, cool, or posture, not for essential quality (though the kitchen product was very solid).
This place serves up top notch bar food. Definitely deserving of four stars. The service however was mediocre at best. I took my parents for dinner and we sat at the bar for a good twenty minutes before someone offered us a menu. My dad isn't the most patient person in the world so we went out of our way to put our order in. That being said the food was very good. I started out with the vegetarian chili. Absolutely delicious. Lots of Flavor, lots of heat. Just enough to make your forehead sweat. For my meal I had the can chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. Very good sandwich, not dry, with plenty of spice. My parents had the turkey sandwich which was even better. The turkey wasn't processed it was freshly carved and the bread was toasted perfectly. Had the service been a little better I would have been at 4 stars all day long.
Pina Colada, banana pudding, raspberry coconut lime, sweet potato, red velvet, strawberry, and chocolate are just a few of the slices of cheesecake sold here at Farrar's and I am ashamed to say that I have had quite a few slices from this little standalone booth located inside of 7th Street Station.  Each flavor has a slightly different crust and you can taste that they use only quality ingredients to come up with some of the best cheesecake in Charlotte.  The raspberry coconut lime would normally be the last flavor I would even think about ordering but after trying those flavors together it is now one of my favorites along with the pina colada......this place makes a very serious cheesecake if you're in the uptown area.  I was told that the restaurant Delta's serves their sweet potato cheesecake for dessert and I can certainly understand why.......yum times 3!  Oh, but do be prepared to open the wallet as the slices run about $6-$7 each.
This place definitely won me over. I was pretty skeptical of dishing out for a photo booth, but my wife really pushed for it and I'm glad I listened. They set up a booth in the corner where guests would go in two, three, four (maybe more) at a time and pose for pictures. They have a bunch of fun props like wigs, hats, glasses, etc. Within seconds, the attendants would print copies of the photos for people. Guests seemed to love it - there was a line for most of the time they were there, and it as really fun for us to go through all the photos afterwards (they gave us all the photos digitally... getting prints would've been great, but maybe that would've been cost-prohibitive for them).   Though they came down in price, it was still a little more expensive than I wanted to spend at the time. However, using Vintage Photobooth Rentals was certainly the right choice for us and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a way to add some extra fun to their wedding reception or other event.
It's a McDonald's. What can I say.  Our food came very quickly. The interior was very nice, consisting of booths, tables,high tables, a fireplace, and a play place.  Dined 6/6/2016.
Before trying Froyona I had never had frozen yogurt before and since then I've spent a considerable amount of time mourning those lost years. This place caught my attention because I was driving by and there was a line!  You've got the standard flavors like vanilla and chocolate and then you've got flavors like root beer float, cake batter, cookies n' cream. What's really cool is that the flavors don't stay the same, almost every time I go in there are different flavors and they offer samples.   Now, let's get to the toppings! There are several different sauces to choose from like caramel, hot fudge and butterscotch. Just a few of the toppings are brownie bites, cream cheese bites, reese's pieces, m & m's, frosted animal cookies, white chocolate, dark chocolate. There must be at least thirty different topping and they are all delicious! The shop itself is really nice too with comfortable chairs, natural lighting and the staff are helpful and polite.  The ONLY reason I didn't give this place five stars is the serving sizes. There is only huge and ginormous. I'm sure this has to do with the fact that this stuff is sold by weight so they encourage you to indulge. Usually, I do, and then I kick myself for putting to much in my cup. I've gotten pretty good at keeping tabs on how much I'm putting in it but those cups fill up fast and if your not careful you will dread that scale. My total usually tallies around $12 and that's for me and my son (don't just assume it was for me...). I wish they had a smaller cup for when I want to have just a taste and I won't have to worry about packing on the pounds on either scale....
I am a loyal customer and love the place! The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars is that it is pretty pricey but it's clean so I love it!
Really enjoy the store.  Temperature of the yogurt is colder than some of the yogurt stores I have frequented.  As I must watch my sugar intake,  I think they don't have a selection of sugar-free flavors.  I don't care for S-F  strawberry-banana, as it tastes too sweet.  Would love to see S-F cookies and cream, chocolate or tart vanilla.  Would then rate the store 5-Stars.
They've recently added TONS of flavors, teas, smoothies, frozen espresso drinks, etc. Definitely worth stopping by. I wasn't too fond of them at first, but with the expansion, they're worth a visit!
Who said you have to cheat on your diet to satisfy your sweet tooth? Not Rita! I don't know shit about Italian Ice, but what I do know is I loved Rita's and It exceeded my expectations.  They just opened and it seemed every kid in the valley has a job at Rita's and they all work at the same time. All of them friendly and eager to answer your questions and provide samples. It was overwhelming for me a bit, but I appreciated it since it was my first time. Hell, I would rather see them here instead of ODing on bath salts or tagging the neighborhood. Who cares? It's all about the product.  I LOVED IT. They had Sugar-Free Cherry and Sugar-Free Mango Peach Ice made with Splenda both which I highly enjoyed. The ice was soft and the flavor tasted so far from anything Sugar-free I've tasted in a long time. On this day they gave me a Regular Italian Ice for free which I chose to have both flavors. I also had to try the Italian Ice and Custard layered which is called a Gelati. I went with Vanilla custard and the Sugar-Free Mango Peach Ice. This was heavenly considering it was 250 degrees outside. I had every intention of just taking a few bites and throwing it out, but of course that didn't happen. I ended up inhaling BOTH of the treats! I had brain freeze into my nose which was awesome! Little Miss Frozen Face at your service!  Downsides- The space they have chosen is VERY small. There is nowhere to stay and enjoy your Italian Ice. There is only one bench outside. Good luck getting it. I sat in my car to grub. Also the price seems high for the sizes. The Regular sized Gelati was around $3.50 and it was very small. The custard is SO filling it was more than enough for me. Also online there is a product called the Slenderita which seems to be a low fat soft serve I was hoping to have instead of the custard. FYI, they do not have it and it is discontinued. It was also weird that there was no music playing.    Overall I loved Rita's for offering the most superb Sugar-Free dessert option in my neighborhood. Thanks for helping Henderson stay cool this summer. I cannot wait to go back and try more!
Orange Italian Ice + Vanilla Custard = Orange Creamsicle Gelati goodness. MMMMMMMMMM SOOOO GOOD
I've been back to Pennsylvania many times to visit inlaws, but I have never made it to a Rita's Italian Ice back east. So I can't tell you if this is legit, back east style Italian Ice. I can tell you that it's DELICIOUS.   I stopped in after dinner with Jaime W. for some desert. I sampled a lot of the flavors, you can practically get full just off the samples. Service was great, almost too friendly? It was slightly overwhelming to have multiple staff members suggesting I try different flavors. I'd rather have overeager service then surly, pissed off people serving me food though...  I came very close to ordering the swedish fish flavor until I tried the watermelon... AMAZING. So cool and refreshing, it was the perfect treat for the hot summer evening! I ended up ordering a Misto, which is an Italian Ice mixed with custard. So tasty. I am practically drooling while I think about it as I write this.  Jaime asked about the sugar free flavors, and the owner told her they were changing it the next day because someone had requested a specific flavor. I thought that was a nice touch, they clearly care about what the people coming in want, and are looking to please their customers.   Make sure to sign up online for their birthday club for a freebie!
I am not from the East Coast so I am not going to be as critical.  I have never heard of this place before.  My wife and I were at the Hobby Lobby and we noticed a sign that said Rita's.  We were all excited because this is my daughter's name.  We wanted to check it out but didn't have the time.  My wife has some friends from the East Coast that were talking about this place.  So on a weekday after dinner we decided to go get a treat.  We walked and I didn't know what to expect.  What the heck is a gelati? There was about 4 or 5 teenage girls manning their stations.  We were greeted by the owner.  He was nice and offered samples and gave a some back story on the products.  My wife and I ordered the same the thing, which I know is kind of lame.  We got the mango gelati.  My taste buds were going insane!  This was a different kind of treat.  We both thought it was yummy and refreshing.  We talked with owner for a minute and then went to the park to enjoy our ice and custard combination.  If you are from the west like us go try out!  Cheers!
I am by no means an Italian Ice connoisseur, but I do know what I like and I like Rita's.   I was in the area during lunch and thought this was a good alternative to a big heavy meal, since it's so warm. I stopped by and they were pretty busy for lunch. I sampled the watermelon and the Sour Patch Kids flavors. I had had my heart set on a sugar free option, but they only had tangerine and I don't really like that flavor in dessert form typically, so I steered clear. I went with the Sour Patch Kids, which had a nice fruity and tangy flavor. I ordered the regular size, but the girl behind the counter recommended I go with the large for only 50 cents more. How can I argue with that? Haha.  It definitely hit the spot on this hot and humid (yah, humidity in Vegas!) day. If I lived closer, I would probably be a regular, so I'll probably still make CJ's my dessert place of choice for now, but this place is a great option on the East side of town!
Rita's...the new darling of Las Vegas Yelpers has been getting a lot of attention. I read some reviews that mentioned custard. Oh really? I know custard, I have custard air shipped from the famous Ted Drewes Frozen Custard in St. Louis quite often so would Rita be good enough to make me think about cutting back on the Missouri resupply flights? There was only one way to find out and so off I went.  Jessie B. and Jaime W. touched on the service which can be a bit, dare I say it, too friendly? But once you get past that and get a sample in your hand that's all it took. I was ordering a Gelati about two sample spoons later. I ended up with a vanilla and cheesecake Gelati...my sample was a chocolate / vanilla swirl and I wanted that in the Gelati but didn't get it. Still I grabbed my cup and headed out to my car, and even though I was running late I couldn't seem to find the gear shift as my hand was too busy holding the spoon and the other one was on the cup. I couldn't go until that cup was empty. I wouldn't want to spill any of it!   13 hours later I sit here writing this and can think clearly again. And while I like the Italian Ice it's not as good as the custard. Their custard is really, really good. Not quite Ted Drewes good, but for Las Vegas it's the best I've found so far. I won't stop the Missouri resupply flights, but I won't need them as often thanks to having a Rita's in the valley.   Well worth the time to check out and it's not over-hyped. It's really really good.  4 Strong Stars. I will be back and I'll be bringing others with me to try more of it.
I came here wanting to try the creation that Vince L posted here on yelp, but they did not have the orange ice today.  I tried a total of 3 flavors and decided on Black Cherry.  Vince L's format would be: Black Cherry Italian Ice + Vanilla Custard = Black Cherry Creamsicle Gelati goodness. MMMMMMMMMM SOOOO GOOD   The staff were friendly and the older gentleman at the cashier was sweet as pie.  I would totally come back for more.  I'm a fan.
After finding out that there's an Italian Ice place here, I most definitely had to try it! I had just discovered Italian ice before moving to Henderson and was super excited that I wouldn't have to leave it behind.   The couple that runs this place is extremely friendly and they're all about customer service. They want to make sure you get exactly what you want and they have the biggest smile on their faces. If you don't know what you want, they give you huge samples. By the time you're done sampling everything, you may think you're too full for an actual order of ice. But trust me, you need to make room.  The must-have is the Gelati. It's their Italian ice layered with their frozen custard. This combination makes it possible to make a creamsicle out of any flavor you want. Lemonade creamsicle? Why yes, thank you! I've been here multiple times and I can say I've never been disappointed. The stand-outs had to be Sour Patch Kids and Mango-Orange. Their custard is a little bit richer and buttery than I've had before, but it still goes perfectly with their ice. The ice is so smooth and flavorful.  When you come here, you will leave with a huge grin on your face. Great treat for the desert heat!
Yummmm!  This place is great!  Lots to choose from!  Staff is friendly and the product is awesome!  I had a gelati and they give you your moneys worth!  I will come back again!
I remember a lot of Yelp hubbub about this place a few months ago but I didn't try it until today. I liked it, but I felt that I needed all the toothpaste in the world after I finished eating. This is definitely not a daily or even weekly treat, not for my teeth nor for my waistline!  All the workers were exceptionally nice. Exceptionally. I had never been there and they were patient while I read the menu and looked at all my options. After I gave them a tip, the owner said to his teenage girl workers, "Girls! You got a tip! What do you say?" like he was their dad, and he may have been. It was cute but kind of strange as well.   I got the "gelati" with cotton candy ice and vanilla custard top. I am no stranger to custard...in the midwest we know how it goes...and this custard was really spectacular. The concept is kind of weird--flavored ice with essentially ice cream on top--but somehow it works.   It is, however, a pricier place for sweeties, but a justifiable price. The serving size is huge, giving me gutrot from its sugary deliciousness.   I will be back, but will probably avoid the gelati in the future. I'm not kidding when I say that my teeth were wearing sweaters of sugar after I got done eating it--I was afraid that they were going to fall out at that moment, one by one. A solid four stars!
As with many others, my first experience of Rita's was back east.  You definitely cannot complain as far as the customer service here is considered. Behind 100% satisfaction! The older gentelman even came to our car to tell us thank you for visiting his location.   Onto the goodness...  I was in the mood for custard so I skipped the Ice but man oh man...it was so lickin' good!!! It was sweet, creamy, full bodied and simply delicious!   I can't wait to go back and get a Gelati. I just hope I can find georgia peach the next time I am there.
Just like home, minus the surly patrons...  Thank you for bringing this to Las Vegas (Henderson) and for the great, friendly staff!! The only thing that makes this place inauthentic is the friendly, helpful staff.  i understand that there will be haters, and they are welcome to go elsewhere. We will make a stop a Rita's part of every family trip to that part of town.
I am used to fluff ice, snow cones, slushies and shave ice. Italian ice or ice water is not something I have encountered before. I came in with hopes of trying something new yet not expecting too much. What I got was more than I could hoped for.  The ice is smooth and goes well with the custard. I agree with Nelson Q. that the custard is not the highest quality. I got a small pumpkin pie with vanilla and it was perfect. I cannot complain about the whipped cream consistency because it was perfect with my choice.   The service was phenomenal though. Between my friend and I we were conflicted on which flavor to get. The staff let us try as many flavor as we wanted. Now there are talks to open a couple of other stores around the valley.
You've gotta try the cotton candy ice with custard. It's simply incredible.
I keep forgetting to review Rita's!  I'm a fan from back east and was so thrilled that it opened like our first week here!  And so close to home, no less!    Our first time was one of their first days open, and we ordered plain italian ices (I can't remember which flavors).  The owner was so nice!  He told us that everyone who ordered plain ices got them on the house (I guess as a grand opening promotion).  But we had no clue - my husband had his wallet out and was ready to pay.  We thought this was really awesome.   Always great service and just a genuine treat no matter what flavor you get!  I think any sweet tooth can be satisfied at Rita's.
Nice selection of favors. Store is small and often has a long line, but worth the wait!
This is a pretty cool place for Italian Ice, which reminds me of shaved ice or icee type of dessert!  a.  Brain Freeze - This stuff reminds me of shaved ice, but smoother, or like an icee, but a bit thicker!  No matter what, if you chow down on this stuff, you willl get the inevitable brain freeze!  For texture and taste and all, I give this a 4 star.  b.  Italian Ice Flavors - They have all sorts of really cool flavors that are surprisingly good. You will not find cold stone / ben and jerry type of flavors, packed with ingredients. Instead, you will find such things as mango, cherry, cantaloupe, blubbery, honeydew, key lime, pineapple and other tasty flavors. Kids will be attracted to sour patch kids red and swedish fish.  I haven't tried those, but I can imagine they will be pretty good!  4 star for taste and 5 star for creativity, so 4.5 star here.  c.  Dessert Sugar Free- they do have some sugar free stuff for those of you watching your intake.  These are sweetened with Splenda, so as long as that is a product you can consume, go for it.  They have a lot of flavors, but seems that at certain times, they only have a sampling out of 1-3 types.  4 star.  d.  Other stuff- They have Cream Ice, Frozen Custard, Gelati, Misto and Blendini.  YOu all know what Frozen Custard is, I haven't tried it here. The Cream Ice is just like the ice that is the main attraction to Rita's but with Cream so it is silky smooth and a really rich flavor.  Gelatai is a combo of their Italian Ice and Frozen Custard. The Blendini is where you use the Italian ice, frozen custard and then add in toppings lke Oreo, Heath Toffee, Snickers and etc.  So, if you want or need the more rich and candy like flavor of traditional ice cream, this could be your choice - 4 star.  e.  Misto - this is the Italian Ice and Frozen Custard made into a drink, more like the icee we all grew up with.  All the other products you use a spoon, this one,  you use a straw!  This is a very small, but nice place. Only seating is two benches outside on the curb facing the cars and so, not a place to hang out and chill out.  While a problem, if you are with a group, you will be standing on the curb of the parking lot and clogging up the store front. Otherwise, this is a nice alternative to your traditional cold desserts!  GK says check it out!
I love this stuff!  I thought I didn't like Italian ice for some reason but this shit is good!  I got the red velvet and my kidlets got cotton candy, and Swedish fish.  They had lots of great flavors I didn't even know you could get in Italian ice like mint chip?!?  Can't wait to go back and try some of their other treats.  Rita's will def be in regular rotation for us this summer.
Out of vegas and we saw rita's and decide to get a sweet cold treat.  I had a sour ice that was pretty good.  They sure do have tons of flavors for sure.  The have some great gelato also if that's what your into.
I finally found an occasion to visit these guys: my half-birthday.  Yes, they give out coupons for a free regular Italian Ice on the halfway point between birthdays. Yes, I was too lazy to go (and a fool not to go) on my actual birthday. And yes, I am a huge sucker for mango flavors. So I am deliberately giving this place only 4 stars until I visit a second time to try to avoid these biases.  However, the texture is really good and the flavor is solid. I hadn't had Italian Ice before, so I thought that it might be something like shaved ice, but it really isn't. The flavor is consistent in every bite and the texture is really nice like a sorbet  I did have a sample of some sort of chocolate flavor, but it didn't work well without dairy support.  Also, I just realized that I can probably get two flavors at least in my next cup. Guess I'd better come back soon to rectify my mistake.
My first time ever hearing of Rita's, but I am glad we stopped. The custard is kind of like soft serve ice cream but creamier (or more eggy, but in a good way). The staff was very friendly, and the Italian ice is really tasty with loads of revolving fun flavors.  I came here twice in my week visit to Vegas and would for sure come again!
My family all love Rita's! They are fast, the owners and the kids working are all super friendly.  I could eat this stuff everyday.  The main reason we don't, besides the calorie/sugar load? Seating, or I should say, the lack of seating. 100+ degree days and 2 young kids that only ever want a cone would equal a disaster, if we had to stand outside. Besides, some days I just want to sit with them and chat while we swoon over the classic twist cone.  But with only a two person bench out front I spend all my time telling them to " hurry up and lick faster"! Hardly relaxing. Also, there is only a storefront, and no bathrooms. Could be awkward with kids. I'm sure the Subway sandwich shop 1 door down, gets some extra restroom traffic because if this. So the product and shop are fantastic, which is really what is important, but those other two issues will hold back a star until they change it.  Which, judging from the location, is not close to possible.  Still if standing up outside is not a bother ( and we do it as often as weather allows) don't hesitate. It's that good!
I have not been in yet...but friends have brought me the sugar free a few times.  I really enjoy.  None of that normal sugar free after taste.  I am dying to go back.
Woooooooo! My friend who is from Boston put this on me and I've been hooked since. Especially since it's UBER hot that this hits the spot.   I got the strawberry Italian ice with vanilla gelato and LOVE how the texture of the ice reminded me of Otter Pops....I love otter pops!  The gelato on top didn't do it for me but, I'll most def be back for the Italian ices.  Lines here are sometimes cray and the workers seem unhappy but, the ice makes up for it for me.
They have lots of flavors to choose from and you can always count on finding something you like. My choice of flavor today was Island Fusion.  The flavors remind me cantelope? A very tropical flavor. All of them are pretty sweet, but not too sickening sweet. I can tolerate up to a regular size. The consistency is pretty smooth and icy brain kinda freeze cold!   Can you get sugar free??..yes.  Is it guilt free??...I'm not too sure.... I've been on a counting calories kick lately and a regular size Gelati w/custard will set you back  400 calories.(via myFitnessPal)  But who's counting?  It's just take n go, no seating area except for the two benches out in front and it's crazy busy with the line going outside the door during the warm weather season. Don't let that deter you though. The wait wasn't long at all and their friendly staff didn't miss a beat when it came time to help us.
This placed was introduced to me by my new boss!  Amazing! The different flavor, the taste, the Custard! I  definitely going back!   Why not 5 star? Customer service was good but not great. Hey I use to be there so I understand.
The ices and custard here are delicious! I got a "gelati" with chocolate frozen custard and cookies & cream italian ice. Definitely something new, and the combination of the textures was quite delicious.  The staff were friendly, and someone (I think it was the owner) went out of his way to come out the back and tell me "Thank you very much for coming here." He sounded so sincere and earnest and I really appreciated it. The girl behind the counter also took the time to explain the different variations of the frozen treats (i.e. what is a gelati) and since this was my first time coming here, it was definitely helpful.  My only complaint (which is why my rating is 4 stars instead of 5 stars) is that there isn't really any place to sit here, only a couple benches outside, so I basically had to take my treat to go. Luckily I live close by, but in crazy triple digit weather, I can see this potentially being a problem.
I had never had this glorious treat until one of my fellow writers on GotGame introduced me to it at a conference in LA. Lucky for me, Rita's is not in LA -- it's right down the road from me.  I mean, what's not to like? Cool treats that melt on your tongue, plenty of flavors, nice people... it's simple goodness.  Sometimes simple is just plain nice. YEAH I SAID IT LAS VEGAS WITH ALL YOUR FANCY PANTS LIGHTS AND MAGICAL DANCING FOUNTAINS AND CIRQUES OF SOLEILS AND STUFFS! So there.
GOOD ITALIAN ICE MEMORIES  I lived in the DMV (DC, Maryland, Virginia) for a couple of years and you could tell when winter was officially over when the local Rita's Italian Ice would post their reopening date. And every summer evening there would long lines to their serving windows.   Back East, Rita's would shut down for the winter. In Hendertucky, they're open all year long. No excuses not to visit with our mild winters.
Good experience! Yesterday, my friend invited me to enjoy Italian food, its taste's quite different from our daily food. the most impression was their customer service, oh you would be treated carefully and funny- they were super humorous and i love them. The great spot for your dinner, i recommend.
I first had Rita's in DC and then subsequently in NJ. This place is awesome and very refreshing for Las Vegas heat. I recommend Lemonade Misto Shake, the Chocolate Custard with sprinkles, or a Vanilla Gelati with Mango Ice.  One vice however..  I can understand that on the East Coast this place normally closes for the winter season (who wants frozen treats in negative snow weather?) BUT with the fact that this franchise has expanded to the West Coast where the cold isn't nearly as brutal.. I think they need to rethink their business plan and figure how to afford staying open through a 70 degree "winter".   Just a little disappointed because I called ahead (no answer) and ended up just driving 20 mins to satisfy my Rita's craving only to find that they are "Closed for the Winter" and "Will see us in March". I'd say they're losing good traction and revenue being closed for such a long time.   Another suggestion is to have a voicemail system indicating that they are closed. It was my mistake for not checking the website (although it says open "Year Round").   Anyhow, I guess I'll have to go to the S Rainbow location in the meantime..
Perfect for a hot day! Vegas traveling in late May calls for gelato and more gelato! All flavors are great!
The frozen custard here is wonderful! The swirl (chocolate and vanilla) is some of the best I've ever had, including New Jersey, New York, Detroit, and Chicago! The Italian ice is also really good, although some of the flavors are odd to me.  The store is SUPER small, so don't expect to pack more than 5-6 people in here without some discomfort. But the service is quick, usually very helpful and polite (I only had one iffy situation) and they make the trip worth it!
I was so excited to come here!!  The custard was amazing I give it a 5 but the icee I wasn't to fond of overall I tried lemon lime cherry chocolate chip strawberry-mango and cucumber melon..  And only really liked the last 2 flavors so as long as u make the right combinations up have a great experience here
The Italian Ice was great. The Gelati thing, well of 4 of us, none of us liked the custard by itself, the Gelati wasn't so bad. I was actually going to give you three stars, then I realized custard isn't even in the name of the shop. You do ices very well, so I bumped it up one.   I would highly recommend a hidden cam mystery shopper though. The employees were great, the User Experience needs a great deal of help. Compared to In-N-Out burger Rita's is the opposite. You have to get everything on the menu explained. You should have faux items split it half with callouts to explain everything.   "It's like a Blizzard?" Why not just tell your customers to go to Dairy Queen? I guarantee DQ focused on core experience for many years before they felt the need to go on a marketing mission to pump up sales. I.E. Enter the Blizzard to break a plateau. You? Focus on Fundamentals!   Get a following, build a line down the street. Burger, yes or no. Fries and a shake with that? Here you go, come back real soon ya hear!!! Drop the Gelati to an Animal Fries like item. It doesn't have to be on the menu. Make it so that only people who are in the know-know it exists. Etc... If it's 110 degrees outside and your staff is waiting for a customer to show up. You're not doing it right. Maybe not wrong, but Purple Penguin is kicking your butt and they can't even stand up in their cart.  The sad thing for me is that I was laying in bed at 1am in San Francisco (Ca) and couldn't sleep because this review was festering inside my skull. Whew!
Stopped by to get some dessert after dinner. Quite busy but that was expected. Gentleman behind the counter was very attentive to the guest that were waiting. Good job! Italian ice was amazing. I am a Swedish fish fanatic and I had to try the ice. Excellent!
I have recently discovered Rita's Italian Ice- and this is one of my new favorite things!  I tried the Gelati..... cotton candy Italian ice layered with vanilla custard- SO YUMMY!
Went yesterday 8-9-15 around 2PM.  This store is located on Stephanie St. between galleria drive and sunset. There is no indoor seating.  You can sit on a bench outside the front door or eat your treats elsewhere.    I got a gelati, which is a cup with custard in the bottom, italian ice in the middle, and more custard on top.    I got the smallest size (regular) which was $4.10. I got strawberry-watermelon ice and it was amazing...probably the best flavor I've ever had there.  There were small pieces of watermelon in it.  Their custard is just heavenly...so thick and decadent!   There's a sign on the wall that says "due to an egg shortage, Rita's will be transitioning to soft serve" or something to that effect.  I hope it tastes the same as their custard.
Rita's is great! They always have something for everyone. My family loves going there, yummy. Might just run up there for tonight's treat.
The ice reminds me of back home in NY when i was a kid and buying those ices from the little man with the cart. That is totally a huge compliment! When i get a urge for a really good icey, this is where i go! Love it!
Ron has been great help on getting an alarm from my home since I moved out to Arizona. I also recommended AZ alarm to my father's company and he's been happy with the system.  Thank you Vince for everything. I will definitely recommend more of our flooring clients to use AZ Alarm.
Great service, friendly employees, fresh food always. Gas price $0.05 higher than most places.
Merrill Ranch is in fact a real housing development. I'm not one for housing additions or Hoa's for that matter! Honestly, after visiting Copper basin, San tan heights, Johnson's ranch I didn't expect much going into this community.  However, I was extremely surprised when I visited. It is a very nice community with a diverse and friendly group of people that live,own and reside there.  I will say I have seen a fair amount of snow birds in the area. However, I have also seen a lot of families.   The amenities this community offers that are covered in the Hoa fee is def worth the price. I have not seen another community offer anything remotely close to it ( water park, nice gym with indoor full basketball courts, rock wall, cafe, child care, full pool with diving boards, free basic cable for residents, ect)   This community also has a golf course, a restaurant /grill on the premises as well as shopping center to include a safe way at the entrance of the community.   The staff, especially Sofia are extremely helpfully and knowledgable. If you are planning to build or buying a home in the area I recommend you at least check them out. You will be surprised!
Went to this new buffet Saturday. Really great sushi. The selection was amazing for a buffet. Really fresh. As noted in the other review they put out small portions of everything and put out fresh all the time.   The hot items were also refreshed often in the same way. Some of the usual "buffet" things but some unusual and creative things as well. Wish they had Hot and Sour soup though.  Service was great. Price is still $16.95 at dinner.  A bargain considering the high quality. nice atmosphere.  A big place.  No beer though!  Bummer.  They are so new that they may be waiting for their license to come through. Should have asked.  Easy to miss this place when driving down Tryon.  Thier sign is creative but hard to notice amongst all the other visual clutter in the area.  All in all a winner.
I only hesitate giving them 5 stars because I have only been there twice. Everything I've had there has been fresh tasting and delicious.  The Sushi looked and tasted great, as did the Sashimi. Selection was good, but they don't keep a large supply of each item out - which to me is not a bad thing, as I feel it keeps it fresher that way.  Another thing I liked was that there was actually space between tables, so you can walk around without feeling that you are bothering anyone. I did not feel cramped  One person complained about something they smelled - but I've had no such experience so far, and I have walked out of restaurants that smelled like a dumpster in the past. I'm not shy about it either.
This place rocks.  Lots of different types of sushi and it is all good...this is not your typical buffet of sushi.    I am not even going to waste time on a review here.....great food, good price and clean place (although sanitation score is 92.5 i believe....
I  am the cold chill creeping up your legs. I am the monster hiding under the bed. I am  the bullfrog devouring anything I can wrap my mouth around. I am the copperhead lying in wait. I am the lion, and you are my pawn. I am the wormhole sucking up any unsuspecting mass floating aimlessly in my wake.  What is this abomination wandering among the living?  I am every buffet's worst nightmare. I am the hippo that will devour everything in site. I am the killer of crab legs and crawfish.   I am that guy. I am that customer who will commit the gluttonous 3 hour sin. Shrimp Shu Mai beware - I will eat you.   Luckily for fuse, the crab legs were a little stale and obviously frozen for quite awhile. Do we have a new king of all things Asian buffets? Not quite, but definitely deserving of honorable mention.
Overall, a good seafood buffet. Dinner has Crab Leg and Raw Sashimi and price is very competitive. Lunch is good money value, with 10 bucks you could take a supreme Hibachi grill plate with scallop, beaf, salmon, chicken and shrimp. The Hibachi plate and sushi tastes better than all buffet style sushi and hibachi place within 20 miles. ( I am a lover of those two).   However, if you are fans of Panda Express type food, or a lover of American style Chinese food, or you don't like eating sushi and raw fish, then this place doesn't provide a lot of choices.   Things I take every time: Lunch: Hibachi with Beef, Shrimp, Salmon and Scallop, Salmon Sushi, Sea Weeds salad, tomato soup,   Dinner: Same as lunch plus : Raw Fish Filet (sashimi) and crab legs.  For new to raw fish filet and sushi, my suggestion is taking a cup of hot tomato soup first, warm yourself up, then start those cold raw sea products.
Great selection. Sushi. Hibachi.  Will make anything you want.
Very good hibachi, soup and maki rolls. The hibachi has salmon and scallops - that is a great start to a meal in my opinion. The soup has the genuine asian taste to it with black vinegar being used I am pretty sure also a great way to start a meal. The rolls are the standout item here as they are very fancy and at a level that is nowhere else to be found in a buffet that I have seen. The short ribs are delicious. The atmosphere is modern and has lots of tables that are in a quiet location which makes for a much more pleasant dining experience than other buffets in the area. I really enjoy going to this place for lunch.
Quite the popular asian buffet in the university area. If you can recall the location for the old Ham's, this place moved in a little while ago. Although I haven't tried it until recently, I'm glad I did.   I tend to be a Showmars usual in this area, but if I'm feeling a little frisky, I may just wander on over across the road for a more lavish meal, or Asian comfort food. The buffet here is awesome! From Hibachi, to sushi, to chicken, beef, fish, octopus, etc. You name it. It literally wraps around itself, it's so large.  Lunch specials during the week- only 7.95. On weekends, I've heard they offer their standard buffet plus unlimited crab legs for 22.95. I have yet to try them out.   Staff is friendly, only little interaction with them if you chose the buffet. They keep up with your drink refills without issue.  Overall, great Asian buffet!
We have a nice dining experience at Fuse every time. Good sushi, hibachi and many other dishes. The only gripe that I have would be that the vegetables at the hibachi grill are all mixed together in a pan. Other than that I really enjoy eating here. Not to mention the service has always been prompt! I recommend fuse to anyone wanting sushi.
One of the better Chinese buffets in the Charlotte area, this one has a pretty decent selection of sushi items and the remaining hot bar items were tasty and varied. Yep, even a few things that have nothing to do with Chinese food like mac & cheese.  My only complaint is that the times posted on the glass above the sushi were never updated. We were here at close to 2:30 but the times were all marked "10:58" and we did see several items refreshed.  The map pin might be in the wrong place. They're located at the corner of North Tryon and McCullogh, south of WT Harris.
This place is overall satisfactory.  The food was delicious, there was a variety of sushi, unlike at most buffets, and the wait staff was friendly.  My only complaints are that the fried jalapenos and fried crab legs were completely cold and that our waitress was hovering around our table waiting to take out plates and only refilling our drinks once during our two-hour lunch.
My boyfriend and I found this place shortly after moving here, and it's become a semi-regular place to dine for dare nights, going out with friends, etc.  The sushi is always fresh, and with a wider selection than I've seen in a lot of sushi buffets previous. My only complaint is that the hibachi grill ends up tasting pretty bland.
Hibachi is great, sushi is good especially the New York roll. Chinese food is mediocre... Overall good place
Staying in Charlotte for the weekend was a great experience. It was time to go home and didn't want to leave on an empty stomach. My brother was driving around earlier and said he saw Fuse Buffet off the road and wanted to eat Asian buffet and we all agreed.  From the outside, it looks like an old CVS. We weren't sure what to expect but they were open on 11 am on a Sunday afternoon. We walked in and were surprised at how nice it looked. We were seated on the left hand side of the buffet at the booth area with chairs.   The buffet setup style reminds me of Golden Coral. There's a hibachi and sushi side to the buffet all the way on the left hand side. I was impress with the many option of shrimp dishes, which all were very flavorful. I was also surprised to see frog legs on the buffet! There was also lobster and fried crabs too. If you want the King Crab, it cost $10 extra per person and it's also all you can eat. Didn't try the hibachi. The sushi was good.  We all enjoyed ourselves. While checking out, the owner asked me how everything was and I told him how great the experience was and loved the many shrimp dishes because I don't see that in Atlanta.
these guys are hit and miss and I've seen both ends of the spectrum. usually everybody there's real friendly but the glass chip guys are like buzzards. I got a nice car so I expected to be taken care of, so I guess my car gets treated a little better than the 1984 chevy blazer, but the times when they are done and I still see glaring issues is really annoying- yet they'll still take care of it. but i'll always go back here. and if you're into lame forearm tribal tattoos, I think that's part of the interview process that you must have them if you want to work there
Also suprised by the reviews. Service guy was friendly and no upselling once I told him exactly what I wanted.  My jeep was extremely dirty from a recent off road trip, went through the drive thru and the kid that dried the Jeep did a fantastic job. I only paid 9.99.
Really surprised at some of these reviews!  I have had my oil changed and car serviced here since they opened.  Have had a few different managers but all have been very polite and most of all honest.  Never pressured and they keep good records of my service.  Occasionally, I have been disappointed in the washes but have done so at other car wash places also.  Very minor things! I will definitely keep coming here!  Job well done again guys!  Charlotte
Was a big fan of the original one in the north west and I like the fact that it is closer to my house with this one. Tried the angry kimchi fries.  Angry Kimchi Fries: Man, I really liked this dish. Sweet potato fries covered in grilled kimchi, pork bulgogi, cheese, and hot sauce. This hit my tastebuds in so many different ways. They also have some intersting combo's of hotdog's.
First time trying this place out. Heard great things about their other location. Came with the hubby because he was dying to try it. The location is rather strange. It's actually located inside a bar (MVP). When we got there, we looked around for a while for a hostess or server, but saw neither. We went to where the tables were located and still nothing. We walked up to the bar and asked the bartender about ordering food. She gave us menus and informed us that we had to walk up to the window where the food was and order the food directly from there. I'm guessing the restaurant part is privately owned?  Anyway, we ordered a couple different things and shared. Ordered the banh mi hotdog and the regular bulgogi dog and enjoyed both! For fries, we ordered the angry kimchi fries (sweet potato fries with mounds of toppings on it) and also the regular garlic seasoned fries. When we looked at everything we ordered, we said,"Wow, this is all so unhealthy and fattening!" lol. Then we gobbled it all up. Aside from the strange location and lack of service, the food was very yummy. I think next time we will try their other location. I believe that one is a full restaurant.
My review is more like 3.7 stars just because of the location. It is not ideal. The MVP is not a trendy bar by any means. One time I came here and a drunk was asleep in one of the chairs. I can't complain too much though because they have cheap beer plus they Yelp check in offer for a free beer.  The first time we checd out the Fort Apche location I made the mistake of ordering a dog with like everything on it, plus chili cheese fries! It ended up being overkill although I really liked the chili.   I've larned my lesson and now just order a chili cheese dog or the fries, not both!   Do come here for the food but don't expect ambiance.
Out garage saling in the brutal heat, the Sno-balls signs practically sang to us. Sweet refreshment! The owners are very nice and attentive. There are so many flavors that it's almost impossible to choose. Plus: sweet cream! One word: nom.   No, it's not Hawaiian shave ice. The freaking name is Sno-balls, people. Geesh!   They are tucked away in a strip mall off of Whitney Ranch, you kind of don't know it's there unless you've been there before. Watch for those siren signs. Worth the cool, refreshing stop. Plus, they always have the game or races on.
I guess Im lucky? We live near NNY so we eat there a few times a month. First off they now have sweet tea, thank you. The pizza is above average and they will bring you several different wing sauces if you ask. Josh was our waiter last time and he was amazing. I will be asking for him when I return. Can't complain, it's been good.
Food is always great quality! Great sports bar. Service is always fantastic. Ashlee was great!
Good wings great service very busy other food is also good as well beer is extra cold. Sitting is great host really helpful
The service was good. The food came out pretty quick.  I really love the wings, they were crunchy and the sauce that was on it didn't over power the chicken. The unsweetened mango tea was especially good and very refreshing!
The shredded pork queso is the bomb! Food portions are large and tasty. Service needs to improve. Though we were immediately seated, we waited for quite a while to order. The server also brought us the wrong drink and forgot our carrots for the wings. Service can mean the difference in a dining experience.
We love the food and atmosphere.  They try and accommodate and put the sport on that you would like to see.  However, we almost always have to ask for the Diamondbacks to be put on the TV and they are the local team.  We usually get the wings but the California Cluck, Cheese dip with Pork are also excellent.  They have a decent margarita also.  For the most part we get good service and good food but we have had on occasion less then par service.
Yummy, I love Native's wings! You can choose how many you want of each flavor and not have to order an entire plate. Also there is something for each member of your picky family :)
I came here on a hot Friday afternoon. I really can't comment on their ice cream sandwiches because I had just gotten a scoop of the Black Cherry THRIFTY ice cream! MY favorite flavor! The place is cute inside and customer service was good. They use iPads for their POS so that's pretty cool! I didn't give this place 5 stars because it wasn't anything extraordinary out of this world type thing....maybe next time I will try and ice cream sandwich and see if that blows me out of this world!
Fresh Baked Homemade delicious - Cookies. The kind that could potentially outperform your own Mother's Secret recipe. Sweet Addictions staff is uber happy and friendly the place is immaculately clean and fun Filled - May need more Tables and Chairs but they deliver the goods Insane Thrifty Ice Cream and amazing cookies, Mix and Match your favorite and create an Ice Cream Sandwich - Can't wait fr a Green Valley Opening (Hint hint..)
Tasty treats and great pricing. What's not to love?!?  A variety of freshly baked homemade cookies which you can combine in any variety with the various flavors of Thrifty ice cream. You could literally get a different treat combo here ever time for months. 2 single scoop cookie sandwiches and 2 milks was under $10, so the pricing is very reasonable.  I liked that they had the nostalgic treats mixed in with new technology as they were using iPad's with the Square credit card service as registers.   My only complaint was they were a little slow, obviously not expecting a summer evening rush about 9pm, but they should have being newly opened in my book. Otherwise, they would have 5 stars from me.
I used to be in this building at least twice a week, when it used to be Waffles. When i saw something else had taken it's place, I just had to try it.   I was pleasantly surprised upon walking in. The decor and layout of the store was so different. To my delight, they served Thrifty's ice cream !!   They serve mainly ice cream cookie sandwiches, but you can also get just ice cream, or root beer floats. As far at the sandwiches go, they said their cookies are made fresh everyday. You can pick two different cookies and ice cream to go in between all for only three dollars. THREE DOLLARS !!!   The cookies were great. They were fresh, and nice and chewy - just the way I like them. Two I had were great, [chocolate chip w/walnuts, and M&M cookie] were delicious, and not sweet at all. They stood up great to the mint chocolate chip ice cream I put between. THRIFTY'S MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP [I love Thrifty's] !   They also have a variety of different sodas, most of which I had never heard of. Next time I go, I'll be sure to try out one of their sodas.   I only wish this place was closer to me. Actually, I don't. I don't need to be eating ice cream sandwiches everyday, haha.
Love the concept. Who doesn't like ice cream sandwiches? They did a great job of transforming the old Waffles Cafe space. It looks a million times better. The staff is super friendly and informative.  They serve Thrifty ice cream, which seems to be a big deal to anyone from California. To me... not so much. I grew up on the east coast. The ice cream, however, is very tasty. $3 will get you your choice of two cookies with two scoops of ice cream between them. I think that's a pretty good deal.  I got strawberry cheesecake ice cream with chocolate chip walnut cookies. The ice cream was smooth and creamy, the cookies were too hard. It was tough getting the sandwich out of the styrofoam container, so I just ate it out of the cup with a spoon instead. No biggie.  My son got the rainbow sherbert with chocolate chip cookies. He loved the ice cream and his cookies were perfect -- chewy and moist. Perfect for taking a bite out of without the ice cream shooting out the back. Just like his dad, he doesn't like to share his food, but I managed to try a little bit.  With ice cream sandwiches it's hard for anyone to top Coolhaus in LA, NY, etc, in my mind. They've got a ton of unique flavors. I'd love to see Sweet Addiction add some crazy flavors like that (whether they make it themselves or source it from someone else). In the meantime, I'll have no problem enjoying the ones they do have. It's a great, locally owned shop that I'll be happy to support.
Sweet Addiction is in walking distance... can you say trouble? The husband and I had a hankering for something sweet and stopped in. We didn't grow up with Thrifty ice cream so we asked for a recommendation, we were told the Chocolate Malted Crunch was a winner. We went with that and chocolate chip and brownie cookies to make it a sandwich. The cookies were not the same size and the scoop of ice cream was too lopsided to enjoy it as a sandwich, but that's not to say it wasn't enjoyed. I loved the cookies. I was less thrilled with the ice cream, I grew tired of the malt flavor, but that's just a personal thing there are dozens of other flavors to try. We were able to save 50 cents by checking in on facebook. My only nitpick is the styrofoam bowls... I have an aversion to sound of friction on styrofoam and the cookies fit snug and the noise is hard to avoid. Bizarre, I know.
We stopped in here about a half hour before they closed on Sunday night, so they were out of a few types of cookies (the white chocolate cookie particularly bummed me out). But, it was late so no biggie!   The lady behind the counter was very nice and friendly and asked us if we wanted to sample anything. We sampled a few before we decided.  I ordered one tuxedo cookie and one peanut butter with Medieval-something-or-other ice cream. The lady helping us said it was a new flavor and she hadn't sampled it but that it had caramel and chocolate swirled into vanilla ice cream. Sold.   After I paid, I actually looked at the menu and noticed that they had toppings like caramel and fudge sauce. I wish I would have noticed that... but I'll keep it in mind for next time.   The cookies were a bit hard, probably because it was late and they weren't as fresh... but they were still REALLY REALLY DELICIOUS, especially the peanut butter cookie. Also, Thrifty ice cream never disappoints and this new flavor was amazing.   Cookies are one of my favorite things on earth.. especially when home made, so this place is a HUGE winner in my book. I will definitely be back. I would also love to see them make some type of a salted caramel chocolate chip cookie (hinthint)!
I swear I was just going to have a bite.....I ended up eating more than my half of the ice cream sandwich goodness.  Home made cookies....about 8 or more different types.  We tried the white chocolate macadamia nut and chocolate chip with walnut....and both were good but I preferred the chocolate chip with walnut since it wasn't quite as sweet.  They serve Thrifty ice cream, which I've been told is the best....you'll have to try it out and judge for yourself.  Overall very simple but creative concept and you can't really beat the price of $3 for two cookies and a scoop of ice cream =)
Yummy!!!! Great way to end a day out with the family!!!
Thrifty Ice cream in between two homemade cookies? Yes please. I can only say what everybody else has said about this place, its amazing!! Any place that has thrifty ice cream, wins my heart. But, they make it even better....throwing 2 warm cookies on top and bottom of my scoop is heaven!  My new favorite spot..
So happy Las Vegas is finally getting more ice cream places. In the desert where it's so hot most of the time, you'd think there'd be one on every corner. I've seen Thrifty ice cream in drug stores around town, but never tried it. It was your average grocery store ice cream. I sampled the Medieval Madness, which was pretty good. But I got the Chocolate Malted Crunch which I've heard so much about. It was okay, I doubt I'd get it again. But I can't wait to try some of their other flavors like Birthday Cake and Circus Cookie. I paired my ice cream with a Tuxedo cookie (white and chocolate chips) and a Snickerdoodle. Their cookies are normal cookie size if you make cookies at home, but they are so good. I loved the Snickerdoodle! You can tell they're fresh, the Tuxedos were fresh out of the oven when I ordered mine, so the chips were melted and gooey. The ice cream melts into them nicely and makes it even better. All this for less than $3 (Be sure to check in on Yelp for a discount on your order.) They even make a Cookie Milkshake, doesn't that sound yummy.  The staff is super nice and patient and will let you try ice cream flavors before you choose.  Looking forward to more visits and sweet treats.
Thrifty ice cream, homemade cookies and tons of combinations to make your own ice cream sandwiches.  What more can you really say?  Simply delish.
After a hefty amount of msg at thai style noodle house (next door), nothings satisfies that sweet craving more than 2 delicious fresh baked cookies and ice cream.  This place has multiple types of cookies you can choose from for your ice cream sandwich.  Cookies were soft and fresh as well.  Defintely hit the spot!
I'll definitely need to try it out more. I went with a few friends and it was our first time (for all of us). We all tried different flavors.  We all tried the Authentic Addict Cookie Sandwich (as you all know, with the $.50 check in, it'll be $2.70 total). That's a good deal. The price was better than we anticipated.  There are many cookie flavors that you pick (you can pick more than one cookie flavor) with your ice cream sandwich. I got the mint chocolate ice cream with the chocolate brownie cookie. Pretty good -- the cookie got softer eventually.  There are a few other things that I wanna try on my next visits so I'll be sure to update with that.  For your first time, it's safe to go with the basic ice cream sandwich and play around with the flavors :).   The place inside looks REALLY nice and clean. It's a good vibe to hang out at with your friends. And they're friendly :).
The ice cream and cookies are really tasty.  The service is great and the overall look of the place is awesome.  Great place to satisfy your sweet tooth!
Upon walking in, the smell of fresh baked cookies drifted to my nose. Just the smell alone made my mouth water! I ordered the Authentic Addict Cookie Sandwich, which is basically a scoop of ice cream sandwiched between two cookies. You can never go wrong with pistachio ice cream between two tuxedo (white chocolate and regular chocolate chip) cookies! Don't forget to check in on yelp for an extra 50¢ off!  The place is somewhat small, so an extremely large party might take up all the tables... also, their cookies are replenished as they run out.  That means if the cookie you want is not that popular (my friend ordered a snicker-doodle), then chances are, the cookie will be hard. You will need to catch them during the perfect time of day if you want a soft fresh cookie!  I will definitely be back, but they need a slight better system to keep their cookies nice and soft. =)
Awesome place!! So yummy.
The cookie monster would wet his pants if he ate here.   Sweet Addiction is a tiny ice cream and cookie shop on Ft. Apache.  I love every bite and every morsel in this joint.  If you don't have time to choose, grab an $8 dozen and head out the door.  You won't be sorry.
Thrifty's Ice Cream!!  While needing an ice cream fix while out with our friends, we stopped by Sweet Addiction.  This place is all about the custom made cookie ice cream sandwiches.  You pick your ice cream and pick your cookie and viola!  While I wasn't interested in the ice cream sandwich, I was able to get a scoop of the black cherry Thrifty ice cream.  My husband got the rootbeer float and our friends each got a scoop of the mint chocolate chip ice cream.  Simple shop that serves Thrifty ice cream.  Service was nice and the place was clean.  I believe they even had gluten free cookies!
What a great concept!  The service was super-friendly.  The cookies are pretty good.  I tried the brownie ones and the chocolate chip.  I preferred the brownie ones.  Thrifty Rocky Road ice cream is always great.  I appreciate their late hours, too.
Sweet Addiction is a small little place located on the west side of town, near 215 and Tropicana, specializing in ice cream cookie sandwiches. Their ice cream's are made by Thrifty. I don't know about you but for some odd reason, Thrifty ice cream is pretty good, despite the brand. Fresh baked cookies daily, and also quite the variety of cookies as well.   Many ice cream flavors + various flavors of cookies equaling many different combinations possible ! Also, you are not limited to have TWO of the same cookie either in the same sandwich !   Nice note for yelpers, little discount upon check-in but valid only 1 per order. So if you want to take advantage of it, and a few people, have everyone check in and pay for their own. Haha.   Staff is friendly and won't rush you if its your first time. Bright, clean environment.   Great for kids ! Price very reasonable. Yummy after meal snack !   --------------------  on the side note, they had this cucumber drink in their side fridge... it was kinda weird LOL
This is a pretty interesting concept, it takes ice cream sandwiches to a new level. The main difference is that they use fresh baked cookies, which they have a variety of different kinds catering to basically anyone. There are a variety of ice cream choices available and the ice cream is made by Thrifty. I've never had Thrifty ice cream before, but it was actually pretty good.    The shop itself is small but a good size, there are plenty of places to sit both inside as well as outdoors if you wish to. It is well lit location with a very friendly staff who can help you make some decisions if you're unsure what you want or if it's your first time. The prices are also very reasonable.   They also have fresh baked cookies that you can buy if you don't want the ice cream, either single, half dozen, or even a dozen+  Don't forget to check in to get the 50cent discount, it's only good off of one receipt, so if you're with multiple people I suggest everyone checking in and pay separately!
Larry is a top rate business coach. His passion for his client's success is contagious. Larry's business experience is a tremendous asset to his clients. I would recommend hiring Larry to help you grow your business beyond your wildest dreams.
Larry is a different kind of business advisor. Do not call him a coach. Hate those types. Larry doesn't do it for you. He essentially wakes you up to reality, finds the holes and gaps in your business and helps arm you with the info you need to help yourself. Plus his NYC accent puts me right back on the east coast. A true professional with real results.
I have know Larry for several years now through BNI and other professional networking events. I have sat down with him on multiple occasions to talk about his experience in advising entrepreneurs, and am thoroughly impressed. His knowledge in running a successful business comes from his first hand experience managing and owning restaurants and other businesses. If you are looking for a knowledgeable professional to help you improve your company, Larry is your guy.
I can't begin to tell you how happy I am to be working with Larry! I look forward to each meeting because his passion to help my business succeed is infectious.  I have said it many times over the last 9 months and I will say it many more times over the next few years, the decision to work with Larry has been the best thing I have done for my business.  Period.  Thanks for everything Larry!
Larry's insight and knowledge of business development is quite impressive. In addition he is a great listener, who truly understands each business owner's individual needs.  I am very excited about the strategy he has helped me to develop to take my business to the next level.  I highly recommend Larry Vivola!
I had known Larry for about a year prior to making the decision to hire Inline Business Advisors and have Larry work with me as my business coach.  Now, almost a year later I can easily say that it is one of the most important decisions I have made for myself and my company.  I have come to the realization that every business owner should use a business coach and the fact that Larry owned, operated and franchised his own business is what makes him qualified, he knows what he is teaching first hand.  Not to mention that he is a heck of a good guy.  As an entrepreneur and owner of K & J Windows in Phoenix Arizona, I have worked hard to build a company that I and my family can be proud of, and now I am working on the business and not just in it.  Thanks Larry! I strongly urge anyone who is looking to grow their business to call Inline Business Advisors and see how they can help you and your company.
Larry of Inline Business Advisors is as top notch as they come. Larry built a true relationship with us quickly and took pride in our business. His knowledge and dedication to us entrepreneurs, put him ahead of the class over other business advisors. We would recommend his services to any one that wants to take their business to the next level.
Working with Larry has been great.  His style is fantastic.  Very smart guy.  Takes things slow and works well with employer as well as employees.  I would recommend in line business advisors to any company looking to increase their bottom line.  Thanks Larry on a job well done
LOVE, LOVE, LOVED Farrar's!!!!! Formally of 7th Street Market, now in South Park Mall outside of Belks, Farrar's has some fiiiinnnnneeeeee cheesecake! I stumbled upon the large refrigerator kiosk while stopping by the mall for a quick pick up. Farrar's stopped me in my tracks! I had a long internal gasp (and probably had my mouth open walking towards the kiosk) as I approached the cheesecake display. All of the little cheesecakes were so beautiful. I was able to sample (who doesn't love a sample?) the Praline cheesecake which was very good, a little sweet. I ended up getting the Red Velvet (my fav!!!!) and Sweet Potato. The color of the Red Velvet was so deep and rich, I almost didn't want to eat it. Gorgeous. It tasted good as well. I was so pleased! The Sweet Potato was also very good. Not overly sweet. They have a large variety of cheesecakes, a great alternative to the larger cheesecake factory, oops, I mean the larger restaurant in the mall that also serves cheesecake. I'm a supporter of this small business and when they get thier own shop, I'll be a regular!
This is the best photobooth I've ever worked with. And as a photographer, I've seen a lot. Guests go crazy over how fun and different this is. It's really hard to find an amazing vintage photobooth rental and this one is perfect. The props are vintage without being cheesy. The attendants dress up vintage too, which adds to the whole ambiance. The photos that you get to keep are so cute!    You and your guests will love this vintage photobooth rental for your wedding. You won't be sorry you booked it!
If you are looking to have a photo booth for an event this is the company you want to go with. They just did our wedding and they were super easy and accommodating to work with. It was the highlight of the wedding! All my guests were raving about how fun it was to have. The set up and props are absolutely adorable! Thank you Catherine and to our really nice attendants who worked it as well :)
Prettiest booth!!   Large enough for big groups. A lot of other photo booths have cheap crappy props from the dollar store. Vintage Photobooth props are beautiful, quality pieces.  AND THEY ARE CLEAN!!  Honestly the best Photo Booth lighting I have seen. It looks event better in person.
Vintage Photo Booth was so GREAT! The staff was amazing! We couldn't be happier with such a wonderful company. Definitely worth having at our wedding! From the props that were provided to the guest book, we loved it all! Wish we had more time available during the wedding to enjoy it more. :)
I've been very skeptical of dentist's office ever since I was a kid and the dental hygienist allowed me to use the water-sucker-thingy on my brother mid-treatment. Needless to say, I was going hogwild torturing him by sucking his gums and lips into the device and she didn't bat an eye.   Healthy Smiles is the exact opposite of dental torture. I've had the pleasure of seeing both Dr Manning and Dr Rauch and am impressed by both of their senses of humor, levels of patient care, and stress-free, no pressure delivery of information. This dentist's office actually doesn't upsell you! Everyone in the office is kind, honest, and knows me (and it seems the rest of their patients) by name.  When they moved from an office in Mesa proper to Chandler, I was thrilled but if they had moved across the valley to Glendale, I would have followed them there, too.   Robin, the office manager, has an excellent eye for detail and will help you find ways to get the most bang from your insurance buck. They also have an excellent referral reward system and a great new patient package - including free whitening trays (if they're still offering that). MJ is the hygienist I normally see, and I would have to say she is without a doubt, one of the most gentle and caring practitioners I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.  I actually look forward to going to the dentist thanks to these folks.
So, I know it seems strange to be giving a dentistry business of all things a 5 star rating but I'll go into why in a bit.   Now, I've never been one of those people that are just terrified by going to the dentist but I never really saw it as a pleasant experience either. It's still one of those things you have to do at the end of the day but they make it such a wonderful experience that it doesn't seem so terrible.   The front receptionist Robin is so genuinely nice- she's also very knowledgeable being that she goes over the dental estimates with you. I had to get a crown and few fillings done and I needed to be numbed up for it. I saw Dr Rauch and his dental assistant Yufumi and they were both very nice, informative and very much about making sure I was not in pain and comfortable the whole time.   I had to space out my dental through several visits and when my temporary crown broke I panicked. I stopped in the morning it happened (I work nearby) and they were able to get me in within 10 minutes and replace the temporary- free of charge.   I am very happy with this dentist and have already recommended their services to friends needing dental work.
I am so scared of dentist... I hate them and avoid them whenever possible! That's what lead me to need a root canal.. Well my normal dentist doesn't do them anymore so I found this place.. And I must say.. Best experience at a dentist ever! I never was scared or even worried, they make you feel so comfortable and dr bauch was great. They never made me feel weird and was so nice.made the root canal super easy. Love it you should come here and hope they take your dental insurance!!!
I joined CrossFit Apollo at the end of December 2011.  I had heard of crossfit and kept driving by this location on my way home.   My mother and I decided to give it a shot so we went to try a class and see if we liked it (your first class is free).  We both agreed it was for us so we signed up for their foundations program that day.  It is a 6-class program that prepares you for crossfit.  You schedule these classes with a trainer and are usually either alone or with very few people.  I loved how one-on-one the training was and how quickly I was able to learn the movements.  After completing the foudations program, my mother and I signed up for a 12 month contract.  It has been about 6 months now and I am absolutely in love with this gym.  It is a welcoming, comfortable, and clean environment.  CrossFit Apollo is very family oriented and the trainers are patient and knowledgeable.  I have seen myself improve on so many levels and could not be happier with my decision to join.   Aside from improving my physical fitness, I have also made a great group of friends at the gym.  I consider this place my second home and attend classes at least 5 days a week. The fun, competitive environment keeps you interested in working out.   If you are considering trying crossfit, stop by this place to try out a class and check out the gym.   The membership price includes unlimited access to the gym, including open gym (which they offer when classes are not in session). Compared to others, CrossFit Apollo is on the less expensive end of the scale for crossfit memberships.They also offer discounted rates for military and family add-ons.
This gym went above and beyond to make sure I had a great time.  The trainer, Chad, ensured I was lifting safely and scaled the workout perfectly for my abilities.  I went with my girlfriend and neither of us had crossfit experience.  I highly recommend you give this location a try.  The people were friendly and competitive but nobody took the workout so serious that everybody couldn't enjoy.
Crossfit Apollo is such an awesome gym! I am in the process of finishing my foundations classes. Everyone there is very supportive. I truly feel like part of a team. This was the first time I had ever done crossfit. I was very intimidated. By the end of my first class, I felt at ease and have been excited to come back each time. I'm only 6 classes in and I can see drastic results! Each time I walk away feeling like I got a great workout in. Each workout is new and never repetitive. I like that because some workouts feel redundant at other non-crossfit gyms.  Would I recommend anyone to do crossfit? Heck yes! Not everyone in crossfit is super beastly. There are regular people there, too! The great thing about crossfit is that it can be modified to any strength and style. If you're considering crossfit, you better give Crossfit Apollo a try! You can try a class for free. So, you have no excuse to not check it out! Maybe I'll see you there.
This place is legit!  Traveling never prohibits me from visiting a BOX and completing a WOD.  This box has everything I have come to appreciate from a Crossfit facility.  The members, coaches, and amenities were better than expected and I would highly recommend to anyone.  The coaches were tuned in and attentive to every person.  I picked up a few corrections which helped me tremendously with my split jerk.  Hitting new PR's is always fun!!
This gym is the best! From day one I felt comfortable. The coaches make you feel like family not just a number in the gym. They motivate you to do your best and will push you to get better day by day!! I couldn't imagine leaving to join another gym!
Love this place! Everyone is so nice and supportive. they make me feel so comfortable and push me to keep going even though i am a newbie and the slowest at everything.
I've worked out at a lot of CF "box's" or gym's as non CFers might call them, Crossfit Apollo is hands down the best!  The entire coaching staff led by Chad Cole is extremely knowledgable and supportive. Crossfit Apollo is my home away from home, I love it there! As if getting in the best shape of your life wasn't enough, Crossfit Apollo has a great social network led by ASC (Apollo Social Crew) that plans amazing events!  Get fit, have fun doing it and make amazing friends at Crossfit Apollo  -Now that's a triplet!
Let me start off by saying I actually own another CrossFit affiliate in town. With that being said, I cannot say enough positive things about Apollo. This is the mom and pop shop of CrossFit gyms. I've been in and out of several CrossFit gyms in Las Vegas and none are as welcoming as the coaches and members over at Apollo.
I love this place. The trainers are amazing and are always there to motivate and help no matter the person's abilities.  The atmosphere is fun and challenging. Everyday is something completely different so you won't plateau.  I was scared when I first joined that my skill level was going to be too low but it didn't matter at all. Out of shape or in shape it doesn't matter.
I absolutely love CrossFit Apollo!! They were so welcoming from the minute I walked in. Chad and Monica are always there to support you and help you every step of they way. They know every single person individually. They are also very motivating along with all the others in the gym. This place is more than just a gym its a family.
Awesome place!!! Great coaches, fun environment!! :))
It took me over a year to get the courage to try crossfit, however when I walked into Apollo I instantly wished I had joined earlier! This gym is more than just a place to get your workout in, it's a second family. The programming at Apollo is amazing and you never walk out feeling like you didn't get a good workout in. In addition to the excellent programming, the people are amazing! I have met some of my best friends through Apollo and the social crew is on point! If you're looking for a new gym, don't look any further! Apollo is the best!
Great atmosphere with encouraging and knowledgeable coaches. Whether you want to compete or just get in better shape, this is a great place to work out. Me and 4 other members of my family go here and we all love it!
Switched gyms and glad I did! Apollo has really pushed me to my limits and the coaches are amazing. I look forward to every single workout!
I have been doing crossfit for just over a year now. It's the best decision I've made in a very long time and I think Crossfit Apollo has a lot to do with that! Apollo was the first box I had ever been to and I never want to leave this gym after the experiences I've had here!! The owners Chad and Monica are so amazing, helpful, approachable, and so much more. I was a little nervous to try crossfit for the first time but as soon as I got in there everyone was so welcoming and never once made me feel like a dummy when I had no idea what I was doing! The coaches and the community here are so great and going to work out at Apollo is the highlight of my day. I have improved so much physically as well as mentally in the year that I've been here and I would recommend it to anyone, no matter what your age, size, experience, etc.!!!!
I've only done crossfit for about 3 years. I have however been lucky enough to travel all over the country and workout at some incredible boxes. I've met incredible athletes and coaches.  Chad and Wes are by far the best, the most encouraging, well spoken, and the most motivating coaches I've ever had! Between them, Eddy and the comp Team I can't wait to see where I am in a year!
After months of trying different pills to control his pain, we made the difficult choice to put our wonderful senior dog Stanley to sleep. We decided it might be more stressful to bring him into our regular vet, so we searched online and found Dr. Carrie and Full Circle. She would come to our home and help Stanley pass on. I was able to communicate with Dr. Carrie via email and she was informative and kind. She said we could cancel at the last minute if we needed to...everything was on our terms. When the day came, Dr. Carrie and her assistant came to our home and were compassionate and patient. They got to know Stanley and got right on the floor to give him a pet when they walked in the door. When we were ready, they gave us all the explanations and time that we needed with each step. Stanley had a truly peaceful death in the bed he laid in with us each night, in the arms of my husband and I. Our other pets were able to see what was going on, so hopefully that has made things less stressful for them.   After Dr. Carrie and her assistant left, we found they had left information on grieving your pet and a trinket that we have kept nearby ever since. A few days later, she checked in to see how we were doing and then delivered a paw print from Stanley in clay that we'll keep forever.   I just can't say enough about Dr. Carrie and Full Circle. We found her services to be very affordable, but after going through this (and having not-so-great experiences in the past when our beloved pets were euthanized), we would have paid anything to have the peace of mind and compassion we were given.
I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Carrie and her empathy towards our family and the difficult decision we faced. It is never easy when it is time to say goodbye to a trusted loving family member. Dr. Carrie did not make it easy; however, she made it easier.   There was a sense of peace surrounding Duke's final moments. A sense of peace we would not have had in a sterile vet's office.
So, bottom line is that Dr. Carrie is awesome.  Most vets over-prescribe all sorts of medicine - monthly flea/tick, monthly heartworm, etc etc. As a result, I have learned to go to "holistic" vets, but let's face it, some if them are a little TOO holistic for my tastes (I don't think essential oils will cure cancer, for example).  Dr. Carrie is the perfect blend - she knows her stuff and recommends the necessary vaccines/medicines without over-prescribing. She is a wealth of information and is friendly and warm. She is the best!
We love Full Circle! We have an elderly spaniel mix with a host of chronic issues, and Dr. Carrie has been wonderful in helping to ensure that he is as happy and healthy as possible. The support staff is cheerful and knowledgeable, and the space itself is relaxing -- with dog toys in the waiting room to entertain the pooches while you wait for your appointment! They call the day after appointments to make sure everything is going well, and our appointments have always been on time. Full Circle is a wonderful addition to Madison's near-east side.
WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE HERE! Dr. Carrie Donahue did a great job with our pup! After getting terrible treatment at Spring Harbor Animal Hospital, we took him to Full Circle and they fixed our pup right up! She immediately identified the problem - a foreign body in his paw - and removed it. She gave us some stuff to treat it, and 2 days later is looks immensely better. He'll be 100% in 1-2 days. What a relief! We've found our new vet!
I just took my itchy pug in to see "Doctor Carrie" (Donohue) at Full Circle, after using another local vet for several years here in Madison. Without getting into why I decided to look into changing veterinarians, I just want to say that I was *very* (!) favorably impressed with Dr. Carrie's knowledge and obvious consideration for animals. And I came out with all I needed to help put my dog on the road to better health!  While I first got great references about Dr. Carrie from friends, at first I was a little worried when I saw the word "holistic" on the website.  I'm not really a devotee of holistic medicine and firmly believe that sometimes you have to resort to good old pharma to get the job done. But I took the plunge, and I'm so glad I did!  I was very happy to learn that Dr. Carrie uses both methods in her practice! She spent a lot of time listening to me and examining my dog and telling me what she thought would be the best course of action to clear up her itching, including the latest "miracle" drug a friend had told me about.   I ended up leaving with a topical spray for the skin infection, the new med to help with itching, some great advice about nutrition, as well as some more holistic preparations that I'll try mostly because I got a good feeling for this vet... and didn't feel she would knowingly sell snake oil. (And, even if it *is* snake oil, I still ended up paying *less* for this excellent, careful and caring service than I would have at my old vet for just a routine weighing and exam... and no actual treatment).  Dr. Carrie is aces... and I think my pug thinks so, too!  BONUS POINTS FOR FULL CIRCLE: Dr. Carrie puts a bath mat on her exam table, so paws don't slide around so scarily. Very smart!!!
Way better than Sweetie Peas!!  I love this place! Great service!  My favorite is the Hawaiian Sherbet!  I can't find it any other place !!
I hope they never get rid of the Yellow Cake Batter yogurt because it is heaven! This establishment is really clean and I love the presentation of their toppings. There are more toppings to choose from at Froyona than at Sweetie Peaz and Yogurt Jungle. I also like that they do the reward program and your 10th yogurt is free! You don't have to use those stupid punch cards either they use your phone number. I am now a die hard loyal pregnant fan of Froyona.
Great selection of flavors, great selection of toppings, friendly service, and close to home...yep, five stars for me!
Excellent flavors and great toppings. Yellow cake batter and see salted caramel are the best! Very friendly staff. It's our go to place!
Thank you JESUS! Finally there's a place where I can score a strawberry milk tea with boba!! There's also slushies and smoothies.  Oh, and the frozen yogurts really good too.  My daughter and husband had the frozen yogurt and said it was great.  TONS of toppings too!  We used to go to Sweetie Peaz but the owner went a bit cray cray and it was uncomfortable to go there but thankfully I've found a fabulous replacement.  On my way back for another milk tea....
Great atmosphere, cute decor, and very clean. The owners are very friendly, and make guests feel welcome. Great little place for a treat.
Definitely a great place to go to on a hot day. Service is outstanding, yogurt and drinks are fantastic! Especially the Boba drinks! Nice clean atmosphere to chill and hang out.  I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone.   Being from cali, this place now makes my stay here in AZ feel more like home.
This place is now called YoBoba if I read the sign correctly.  I am super excited to have a Boba tea house by me. The boba is awesome!!!!!! Just like the place I always go to in chandler and now I don't need to make the drive.  Super excited to go back.   I did ask if the place was under new management and if is. A new owner.  He was super friendly and the place is as clean as it was before.    Boba and frozen yogurt.  Heaven!
Its the best just like back home. The orange is one of my new favorite flavors because it taste just like an orange not overly sweet like a snow cone. LoL! Italian ice is better than a snow cone! I've been looking for gelati here and I finally got it. So happy Rita's is finally open!
I grew up in South Jersey and Staten Island, where Italian ice has been a staple in my summer diet my entire life. It's a shame Vegas doesn't have more places like this.  I found it by accident, and couldn't have been more excited to see the Rita's sign. After my errands, I decided to stop in and get a quart for the family. It turns out that they just opened. I was greeted by about 10 friendly kids as well as the owners. I purchased my quart for under 6 bucks, and was given a regular size for free. (which I'm sure is just a promo for the opening)   Either way it tastes PERFECT. Reminds me of home and definitely made my day. I will definitely be a regular!
We just drove from Summerlin to try Rita's and I was not disaappointed!! The strawberry has real strawberries and the black cherry has real cherry pieces. All I can say is yum! I will make the drive. Unlike someone in the northwest I got great customer service and the employees here are all smiling. :). So everyone come try out Rita's tomorrow they have half off on everything.
I grew up in South Jersey, and water ice is a summer tradition there.  Rita's has always been a favorite, because of the real fruit inside.  So I was very excited when I found out Rita's was opening in Henderson.  Irving, the owner, could not have been more helpful.  I planned on getting a cherry, because that was always my favorite growing up.  But Irving gave us samples of 4 or 5 different flavors, and encouraged us to take our time to figure out what we wanted.    In the end, I wound up with a pint of lemonade and a pint of black cherry.  I was taking them to a friend's house, so Irving made sure to pack the cups for me and gave me some tips on serving them later.  He also gave me his card, and told me to let him know if I wanted to request certain flavors on another day.   I was already going to be a regular customer, because I love Italian Ice.  But that extra customer service was much appreciated.  I'll definitely be going back to Rita's.  Now if only we can get another location on the west side of the valley...
Wife and daughter saw this one on the show Unwrapped. Had to go. Amazingly awesome flavors of ice and the creamiest frozen custard you will find.  The cherries taste like cherries, the snozzberries taste like snozzberries.  Ok. there are no snozzberries but the owner Irving  and staff are very friendly and you can sample to your hearts content.  They even said if you have a favorite flavor, you can call ahead and they can mix it for you!.  Best service ever.  Try the swedish fish ice and it will bring back childhood memories.  Combine the custard and the ice for a gelati treat.
SUCH A GREAT UNIQUE TREAT! I recommend the Gelati. Very nice staff, good prices too! The people on here that gave it anything but 5 stars need to get their taste buds checked, because it's awesome! The Italian ice is amazing, but even if you aren't an italian ice fan, they have the most unbelievably yummy custard! (The Gelati has both!) Try this place out, you'll love it! Welcome to Henderson, Nevada Rita's, it's a pleasure to have you here, and I'll be in lots and recommend you to everyone!
I had Rita's for the first time last week in Philadelphia. It was so good and I couldn't wait to try this one out when we came back. It was just as good as the one in Philly. So far I have only tried the ice but I can't wait to go back and start trying what else is on the menu. It is a great place to go on a hot Vegas day!
Finally, Rita's in the wild wild west! When i moved here 5 years ago from PA and was introduced to 100 degree plus weather nothing would have been more refreshing than an Italian Ice from Rita's. Nothing else seemed to to the trick. Well the time has come. With so many good flavors to select from I chose the Swedish Fish after a sample. I had it Gelato style with Custard(not ice cream) on the bottom and top. It instantly brought me back to the days of old, which was a good feeling. The wife had Juicy Pear which was tasty as well.  The staff was very friendly, greeting you as soon as you walk in in and offering samples and explanations of there cold refreshing treats. The owner Irving was nice as can be. making sure our experience was memorable. It was and i will definitely be back to have more of the excellent flavors of Italian Ice(not water ice) that they offer.
For the record (since Wonder W thinks that I may be a paid, or friend of the owner), I have nothing to do with Rita's.    I just wanted to say thank you for opening up in Henderson.  It tastes just as good as when I would go to the one in Franklin Square, NY.  The only difference is the sprinkles.  I got over that quick.  The custard is just as good, as is the Cherry Ice, which are the 2 things I always got when i'd go there.
Finally they opened a location in Hender-tucky.  I've been Rita's many times when I lived in Huntington Station (located on Walt Whitman Rd, RTE 110) and been to one in Philly that's located at the Mayfair.  I have to say all three of them have been consistently good.  Only difference I can tell is the water they use.  Personally, nothing beats NYC water.  The flavors are excellent.  Fresh and tasty.
I'm so freaking happy.  I moved to Vegas from the Philly area almost a year ago. Before I left, one of the last things I did was went to ritas in Doylestown and got a cherry and chocolate gelato. It was on my philly bucket list. I've eaten ritas ices every since I was a small child. Family members would bring it to cookouts. Kids brought it into school for their birthdays. Every first day of spring is free ritas day, and when I got my drivers licence 8 years ago, the first thing I did was drove my sister and I to ritas for our free ices.   I have missed Ritas for a while, especially on the first day of spring when everyone I know was writing on facebook "HAPPY FREE RITAS DAY!!!" But this year, I'll be able to enjoy my ritas any day!   Most of my rita's experience was authentic. Even the staff working there, a bunch of high schoolers, did a great job of greeting me and offering my samples. The manager was there too. And he was so incredibly nice. I knew what i wanted before I got there- a mango gelato with vanilla custard.  It was just as I remembered it. I've been trying to replace my water ice fix with hawaiian shave ices, and while those are good, rita's is the real deal. It tasted just like it was made in PA. The custard was thick and delicious. So good. I sat in my car (which is the proper place to enjoy your ritas, as very few ritas have seating areas, besides a couple of seats outside), and I was in heaven for nearly 15 minutes.   Now, if only they could open a ritas on the strip, this city would be perfect. It'd be like reliving my college days- drinking with my friends at the bar, and then stumbling down the street to enjoy a delicious water ice.  So now we that we have ritas, are we getting a wawa anytime soon? ; )
I grew up and lived in and around philly til i moved here two years ago. I always wished there was a Ritas here.  Imagine my delight when I moved not two miles from where they were building a Ritas! I watched with eager anticipation as the shop came together.  Finally, they opened. I found out first from Yelp. I was abashed to read the reviews and was nervous about trying it.   But tonight was the night. The test. I brought my 3 kids, 2 of whom had never tasted ritas.   We ordered 4 water ices. They gave my daughter a taste of the orange-colored tropical flavor first for free. We also had cherry, sugar free cherry (for me) and lemonade.  All were delicious. The sugar free is a little lacking in flavor, but thats normal for the chain.   There were two firemen inside as we ordered, and a truckfull arrived as we were leaving.   The owner was present and mentioned he was from philly. So we started a conversation. He asked where i found him, and i mentioned yelp. He politely asked for a positive review.   Now, as a previous small biz owner myself, i have to tell you that its a common (and smart) biz practice to ask for reviews. All the biz books recommend it. I have had no problem asking for reviews of my business  and I have no problem with other businesses asking for reviews either. If someone opens a new yelp account because they like my business, i think thats great. I would hope they would continue on yelp, but if not, that wouldnot really be in my control, just as it is not in the control of this ritas owner.Of course if there are fraudulent reviews, that would be wrong, however, I believe he was just soliciting positive reviews. The owner seemed genuinely upset about all the yelp contraversy.   Well, he got a good review from me. No complaints.  In fact, My two year old dropped his water ice right off, and they replaced it with no questions asked and no charge.  I give a five stars for quality of product and service. I wish there was more seating, all there is is a bench outside, but hey. Its a ritas. They normally dont have much in the way of seating.   Overall - 5 stars.
I'm so happy you have come to Vegas Rita's! Just as awesome as I remember! None of the other places in town compare. Stay friendly and I will be returning very soon!!!  All you west coasters need to try out Rita's Italian Ice!  Double thumbs up!
I am so happy that a Rita's has finally come to Vegas!!! I've been waiting forever and to find out that they finally opened was great! The staff was cheerful and very efficient. Even the owner came out and asked how everything was. We mentioned we were also from PA and it was nice to see something familiar. I missed Rita's every spring and summer and now I can get it all the time!! Flavors are also great and they have a huge selection of different ices. A lot more than the ones in PA.   So happy now, Thank you so much for opening it up!!!!
So glad that Rita's is finally here! The water ice was awesome! I had the mango water ice with vanilla custard gelati. The owner and all the employees were so sweet! Hope they do well out here!
I'm updating my review because it was apparently removed because somebody complained that I (and several others) were employees of the store.  While I would love to collect a paycheck from Rita's Ice or anybody else wanting to pay me money-I am not employed by Ritas (I work for a big casino company in town) and am disappointed that some people can be so ridiculous!    We have returned to Rita's several times since my original reviews and my review stays the same-This Rita's is great!  They have new flavors this week (rootbeer (the hubby had it with vanilla custard and it tasted just like a rootbeer float!) watermelon etc.).  You can't beat the flavor of the ice and I love the different options you have to customize your flavors.  The staff is ALWAYS friendly and very eager to help.    Congrats to Irwin and his wife for opening a successful, unique to Las Vegas/Henderson business...I would encourage anybody who wants a treat and wants to support a local business owner to go check them out!
I'm sooo freakin' happy right now.......  Rita's has finally made it to Vegas.  I moved out here 3 years ago from NJ and missed having Rita's (their gelati is my favorite), but now I can indulge all I want. Their fruit ices have pieces of fruit in them.  The chocolate peanut butter ice is creamy and to die for.  Their custard is delicious.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
Love this place! We had one down the street from my job when I lived in Buffalo and it was such a refreshing treat on humid days. Went here the other night and had the Gelati.  It was whatever flavor italian ice on the bottom with a bit of custard on the top. I had them do mango on the bottom, watermelon on top with the custard and it was sooooooo good!  The custard is the creamiest custard I have ever had in Vegas! They even have Swedish Fish candy flavored italian ice which I tried and it was like slurping on the candy in liquid form. Can't wait to go back! Gonna try to convince the BF tonight! :)     Addition: 10/4/14 - I've gone back many many times and it's still great! I've been getting their custard sundaes. I usually get twist custard, peanut butter, oreos, whipped cream, and a cherry. It's super light and creamy! I love this place!  Writing this, and being as full as I am, I am literally thinking about an Italian ice tomorrow. They have Georgia peach and that looked great!
I will sum this up in two words. GO TRY!!!!!   They have Swedish Fish Italian Ice.  How can you go wrong with that one. Great customer service.   SOOOOOOO GOOD!!!
me & my family were running errands yesterday in 100+ weather and needed something nice and cool. i saw this place on yelp and booked marked it a while ago. we pulled up in front of the shop and as we were getting out of the car a little old man was standing inside and waived at us through the window. of course we waived back and walked in. turns out the old man in the owner and his wife was there along with a  handful of employees. everyone was really friendly and giving us samples of the frozen custard and ices. i got the standard watermelon ice, my step-daughter got the cherry ice with chocolate custard and my hubby got the root beer ice with vanilla custard. i am definitely getting the root beer float next time. it was so refreshing and light on such a hot day. we are already planning on going back.
Amazing, amazing, amazing! Finally the treat from back east here in vegas. The custard and ice was exactly what I used to get in PA. I had custard, cantaloupe and chocolate brownie ice. All perfect. The owner was there and he was super polite and so was the entire staff saying "what would you like to try" as soon as I walked in. Best frozen treat in vegas by far!
DELICIOUS!!!! So Glad you are finally opened! I am from East Coast and its been 1yr since we had our last Rita's in Jersey! The Service was Great, not sure what these other reviewers want from them, to kiss there feet and feed them?? ;)  The selection was just like home and tasted Great too. We had the Coconut-Ice with custard cream in the middle, yummmm and Mango ice. The price in unbeatable in-expensive and delicious  The owners were extremely Friendly very excited for their opening and gave my husband a free ice for his birthday!  Thanks for FINALLY opening the best ice cream in Vegas! Good Luck and many fortunes ;)
The custard is amazing...I think this is an awesome place to go.  All of the people that work there are super nice, including the owner.  They haven't been open that long but I've been back there 4 times already.
For the nine years we have lived in the valley, my husband and I have bemoaned the lack of two things: CFA and Rita's.  Everything has changed!  We found the new Rita's and all is right in our world.  Hubs had the chocolate brownie cream ice( imagine a fudgesicle that you eat with a spoon) and I had half pear half lemonade.  Yum!  Quite a few folks are commenting that there is not seating--  Rita's is not a restaurant, folks.  Rita's is a treat stand.  I, for one, and thrilled that I get to go inside to order instead of lining up outside a window like most places.    If you are looking for a tasty treat for those hot summer evenings, Rita's is the place.  Bring the kids and tailgate in the parking lot-- it's a taste of "back home" for this East Coast transplant!
The ice cream (custard) is very thick and creamy... The way good ice cream should be! The Italian Ice is rich in flavor and texture. There's plenty of flavors available, and everything is made fresh. They also make a sugar-free flavor that is excellent. Everything is very delicious and highly recommended.
They've been open for five weeks, and I have a feeling they'll be opened for many more! I walked in and was greeted with a smile and asked if I wanted to sample anything...having never had Rita's or any Italian ice before, I tried a few - Mango, Georgia Peach, and Florida Orange. While they were all good, I liked the Mango and Florida Orange the best!   Since I'd never had Italian ice or custard before, I didn't know what to expect. However, now that I've had it, I'll try to explain what they're like. The Italian ice is similar to a sorbet, but a little lighter and more icy...duh, hence the ice in the name, right?! ha ha. The custard looks kinda like soft serve ice cream or frozen yogurt, but is similar in consistency to frozen Cool Whip...and kinda tastes like that too.   I ended up ordering a regular gelati (custard on the bottom, Italian ice in the middle, and more custard on the top) with Vanilla custard and Florida Orange Italian ice...think orange creamsicle...YUM! A regular size was around $4.00, but for fifty cents more you can get a large! The regular was enough for me, but if sharing, the larger size for fifty cents more is a good deal.  While this is a franchise, it has a family feel. It is owned by an older couple...the husband was at the register, and the wife was in the back making the Italian ice! Their employees appeared to be high school aged kids, and they all were happy and excited to be working. With all of the hot days here in Vegas, I'm sure to be a repeat customer!
After hearing that a Rita's had opened, I surprised my wife ( who grew up eating Rita's in Philly ) yesterday. She was in heaven after her 1st taste of the delicious chocolate water ice. I consider her an expert! We tried a variety of flavors, and found them all to be exactly like they're in Philly. The owner and his employees are incredibly nice.  My youngest son (10) had the custard, and was in heaven. No more snow cones for this family, just water ice!
Rita's is absolutely AMAZING. I'm obsessed with Italian Ice but haven't found any good places in Las Vegas...until tonight!!!!!!  After barely stepping foot inside the place, a very nice man greeting greeted my boyfriend and I. He warmly welcomed us and invited us to try anything and everything we wished, while giving us information about the business (they're Kosher!).   I got a small Wild Black Cherry with a dollop of custard that was INSANE!!!!! The Black Cherry flavor was strong, tart, and tasted like REAL fruit. There were also real cherry bits. The custard was creamy, not too sweet-but perfect.  My boyfriend ordered a large Cotton Candy with custard that tasted like the yummiest, creamiest treat EVER. The Cotton Candy was perfect-not too sweet, but very warm and comforting.   The owner, Irving, was very sweet. The ice and custard was OUTSTANDING, but even if it were lackluster, I would still go back because of how great their customer service was.  I went tonight and can't wait to go back tomorrow!!!!!
If you haven't been to Rita's yet...the easiest way to put it is, you're missing out! Stop reading reviews and just go now, it's that good!  I'm not from the east coast so the first time we went to Rita's I wasn't sure what to expect. After checking out the menu online, I was actually a little hesitant to try it. The thought of combining italian/water ice and custard just seemed kind of weird. But being the type of person I am when it comes to food, especially treats, I had to head out and try it.   On our first visit, I ordered the Gelati with Wild Black Cherry and the custard twist. WOW! I'd never had anything like it! The ice not only has the perfect consistency, but the flavors are amazing. It even had small pieces of real fruit in it which just made it that much better. The custard was the best I have ever had. It was rich, creamy and full of flavor. Once you combine the custard with the ice, it's just so good! It's something that's hard to explain, you just have to try it for yourself. And if you're not into the two combined, the ice or the custard on their own are more than worth the visit.   Since our first visit during their opening week, we've been back every weekend besides one. Yes, I'm addicted and I'm not afraid to admit it! :P I've tried several flavors of the ice including the cream ice flavors they have on occasion. Some of my most notable favorites are the Wild Black Cherry, Banana, Mango-Orange and Iced Coffee. Even the 'regular ole' flavors like Florida-Orange and Cherry are spectacular and my son absolutely loves the Blue Raspberry and Cotton Candy. If you need a suggestion on what to try, I have to say Gelati. I've had one on each visit and I just can't stay away. Banana w/ twist, Root Beer Float w/ vanilla, Florida-Orange w/ vanilla, Cherry w/ twist and Iced Coffee w/ twist would be my recommendations depending on what flavors they have that day.  As you can probably tell, I friggin' love this place! I'm a huge fan of Luv-It but I would make the drive from my house (Durango & 95N) to Rita's first. Not only do they have the best product in my opinion, but their customer service is flat out exceptional! The owner has been there every time I've visited and any person who steps into that store feels welcome. He takes customer service to the next step and I commend him for that. Just last night when we were there, he even walked outside and took a picture for a couple sitting outside on their first visit to Rita's. My son had even dropped his entire cup of ice on one visit and he refused to let us pay for a new one. In less than a minute, my son had a new cup of ice and the floor was mopped. Beyond him, the employee's are extremely helpful, they smile, offer samples and the store is always spotless.  The one and only downfall to Rita's is the size of their store. There is only one bench outside and the inside leaves no room for seating. It's definitely not ideal to stand or sit outside on the curb to enjoy your treats. However, the quality product and the customer service they offer is top-notch and in my opinion, the seating can be looked past. I have nothing but good to say about Rita's and I will continue to visit and spread the word!
I can't fathom why this place doesn't have a solid 5 stars. Best custard I've had out here, hands down.
I'm not sure why Yelp hid my original review... Regardless, Rita's is amazing!!!! The product is delicious and the service is top notch!  Every flavor is delicious. My standouts:  -green apple -black cherry -watermelon -passion fruit   All have real fruit!!!!! Love, love, love!
An East Coast place comes to Henderson and it is worth trying.  They have some amazing flavors of Itilian Ice.  If you have never had one, YOU GOTTA TRY IT.  This place is NOTHING like the shaved ice places around town.  The place is small, the wait can be long HOWEVER, if you have ever been to Philadelphia, it is normally a place like the shaved ice places out here, an outdoor stand with a line sometimes 30 to 40 minutes long.  The wait is worth your time, you will not be disappointed unless you never stood in line for anything in your life which I find hard to believe that there is a person out there who never stood in line for anything???
Wild black cherry gelati, with vanilla custard is the best thing I have ever tasted!  It is so unique and has real cherries in it!  The staff is great, the owner can be a little lurkey and pushy, but he is a super nice guy!
Okay. My wife and I got down to Rita's to see what the hullabaloo was about. Walking in as newcomers we were promptly greeted with samples so we could make our best possible choice. My wife had watermelon which BTW was hand made with real pieces of watermelon, nice. I have a BAD sweet tooth so I gave Cotton Candy a whirl. Oh dear god the euphoria of sugar coursing through my veins prevents the synapses in my brain from firing correctly to establish the correct adjectives. How does one make "ice" smooth? Custard had all the pure awesomeness of marshmallow cream.   So I say, hullagogetitbecauseyouwillloveitbaloo....
Came here with my girlfriend on a Thursday afternoon... With all the hype going on about this place we decided to give it a try lol...  Everyone in there was super friendly and were happy to go over the things they offered and how they made their drinks/sweet amazingness...My girlfriend and I ended up ordering gelati's... Mine was mango and hers Swedish fish (yes...Swedish fish flavor which was pretty accurate in my opinion)...  The gelati's were amazing, but next time I come in I think I'm going to try the misto bc that was super tempting as well... Oh and I  now have a new obsession with frozen custard lol!  Also, it's really cool that they give Touro students that 10% discount bc with being a medical student like me, any saving is amazing! I will definitely be returning!!
A delightful experience and a special treat.  I took a cab from the strip to come here.  It was worth every penny in cab fare and I will definately come back for this old fashioned custard shop.
Pumpkin pie cream ice is deelish, this is way better than the Rita's I remember back in Philly!!! They don't have all the options available on the website (like no Slendaritas) but the workers were all really nice and patient and let us sample flavor after flavor. Finally I decided on the pumpkins pie and knew I had to come back soon to try all the others. They have yummy custards too and kiddie sizes/sugar free options, if you're watching calories. A very good, cheap treat, this is definitely going to be a popular spot!!
best soft serve ice cream in town!!
The concierge at our hotel in the City Center recommended we come try Rita's. Absolutely worth the short cab ride. The custard was delicious and the Gelati was even better!
So glad to see a ritas out here! Awesome Italian ice just like in Philly! Good prices, and u can sample favors before picking the ones u want.
Coming from Philly, I waited years for Rita's to come to town!  Love Rita's water ice and cherry is my favorite but the coconut cream is moving up in the rankings.  Really everything is great so you can try a new fresh flavor every time you go.  Sign up on-line for specials and email alerts will tell you when your favorite flavor is available as flavors change daily. The staff is super friendly and will help you to decide if you need a sample to try before you buy.
I grew up on Ritas. There are 2 things in this town that remind me of home (Philly). One of them is my family picture on my wall. The other is Rita's. I literally almost caused a traffic accident the first time I drove by and saw their sign. I couldn't believe my favorite dessert in the world had made it west of the Mississippi - and not only that but it made it like 3 blocks from house. I go WAY too often.
The heavens opened, angels flew down and built a Rita's in Las Vegas..well Henderson but whatever. Whether you know and love this place from your former home in the east, or just stumbled upon it after an intense mall session I'm willing to guarantee you're in love.   These ices aren't just any ices. They're fresh, delicious and some even have real fruit in them! My addiction is the gelati and I've never had a flavor I didn't like. Black cherry, swedish fish, iced coffee, mango....I can't stop!! The seasonal flavors are amazing as well, with Pumpkin Pie finishing at the top of my list. I can't lie, I'm so addicted to the gelati that I rarely get anything else but the shakes do look delish.   The owner and his staff are always SO super friendly, ready with a smile and a sample of anything you'd like to test run. Keep your eyes peeled for the red and white sign or you might miss it, it's right near L&L Hawaiian BBQ!
I love this place.  People are super friendly.  Italian ice is awesome!
I'm no expert when it comes to italian ice but wow I really enjoyed their gelati. I thought it was really delicious and had no problem paying a little under 5 bucks for a large. Now whenever I have a sweet tooth I instantly know this is the place to go.
What a great treat! I was visiting a friend in Henderson and we had just finished our dinner and were looking for a refreshing dessert. He had heard good things about Rita's and we decided to check it out. I'm glad we did. The owner of the place was working the counter and he was very helpful. I had tried the custard but I was looking for something more refreshing and he suggested the mango ice. I sampled a bit of it and was sold. It didn't have any artificial quality about it and according to the owner, they use the real fruit to flavor the ice. Quite honestly after finishing it I think the other flavors like pear and black cherry would have been just as good and I'll definitely make a stop the next time I come out to Henderson.
Oh my GAWD!  Love at first bite!   First of all, why don't more people go to this spot? I had the vanilla custard with the black cherry ice. Gelatini--- I think that's what it is called, I basically inhaled the product.   Right to the hips baby! But worth it!
Italian ice was amazing. I can do without the ice cream on the top. I literally scooped it off and tossed it on the side of the road.
I really wasn't looking forward to going here, but our guest in town insisted, because someone she knows, told her she had to go and check it out.  So ya'll know how it is when guest come to town, you have to do the whole tourist thing!  So we got there, they were spit-shining this place!  OMG, if they weren't serving anyone, they were shining it up!  I don't think you understand!  They were on the floor, on there hands and knees!  So I thought it was just going to be like and Icee!  Nope, it was like an ice, but it was creamy in the mouth like ice cream.    I tasted several flavors, cotton candy, and watermelon was my favorite.  My husband got the custard!  That wasn't Italian Ice, it was a custard, but it was kinda weird, it wasn't cold like ice cream, it was a lot warmer than I liked.   My husband loved it, but he's a custard lover.  We also met Rita.....He's a man, very nice guy, he also gave us a couple of buy on get one free coupons.  We will return.
We came here on a Sunday night and got a regular sized gelati for 4.10 *Up to 2 flavors of Italian Ice Cream *Choice of custard (Chocolate, vanilla, swirl)  - Next to Galleria Mall - Custard is creamy! - Need the custard to balance the Italian Ice. Perfect combo. - Really sweet! We got the Swedish fish and tropical flavor - Better than CJs, but more expensive.  - DL their app, sign-up, so that you can get a punch card. buy 8 get 1 free. - BTW, password needs to be more than 6 characters or you can't proceed!
Yelp pretty much says it. AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Rita's fills the craving if you want a slurpee, ice cream, a milkshake, any dessert!! I was so happy when they first came to Vegas. I am a HUGE Italian Ice fan, and my other half likes the custard. Here you can choose to blend the 2 together and create a misto. I really love the black cherry ice.  The owner, Mr. Dobbs, is such a sweet man. He truly teaches his team the meaning of good customer service. I have never once went into Rita's and had a bad experience. As a matter of fact, they are the type of employees that go out of their way to make you happy, even if it means sampling 5 flavors.  I was lucky enough to get my hands on some coupons and let me just tell you, every single one will be going to use!
My wife and I go for the custard.  We get the twist in a waffle cone and it is thick and tasty!  The place is clean too and the people that work there are nice.
The different flavors are all amazing! So far I've tried the watermelon, Florida orange, juicy pear, and mango Gelati. I've also sampled the red velvet and wild black cherry which were equally amazing!  There are many other choices, too! I've yet to try a Blendi. They blend Italian ice, custard, and your choice of candies or Oreo cookies together.
Love Rita's great Ices and the staff is very good.  My favorite place to bring the kids for a treat.
